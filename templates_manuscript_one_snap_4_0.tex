	\begin{abstract}
	The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is due to commence the 10-year \gls*{lsst} at the end of 2025. 
    %This ten-year wide-field survey will detect variable/transient sources, issuing public alerts within 60\ s of image readout. % DMTN-102
 % Rubin Observatory intends to issue public alerts announcing variable/transient sources detected in each observation within 60\ s of image readout. 
To detect transient/variable sources and identify \glspl*{sso}, the processing pipelines require templates of the static sky to perform difference imaging. 
During the first year of the LSST, templates must be generated as the survey progresses, otherwise \glspl*{sso} cannot be discovered nightly. 
The incremental template generation strategy has not been finalized; therefore, we use the \gls*{maf} and a simulation of the survey cadence (\baselinefull) to explore template generation in Year 1.  
We have assessed the effects of generating templates over timescales of days-weeks, when at least four images of sufficient quality are available for $\geq90\%$ of the visit. 
We predict that \gls*{sso} discoveries will begin $\sim$2-3 months after the start of the survey. 
% We find that \gls*{sso} discoveries will benefit from early template generation, especially in areas of the sky that are not covered as frequently by the survey, such as the \gls*{nes}, and in less commonly used filters, such as $g$ and $u$-bands. In addition, we find that the lack of templates in the \gls*{nes} has the greatest effect on reducing the number of \gls*{sso} discoveries.
We find that the LSST's ability to discover \gls*{sso}s in real-time is reduced in Year 1.
This is especially true for detections in areas of the sky that receive fewer visits, such as the \gls*{nes}, and in less commonly used filters, such as $g$ and $u$-bands.
The lack of templates in the \gls*{nes} dominates the loss of real-time \gls*{sso} discoveries; across the whole sky the \gls*{maf} \gls*{mba} discovery metric decreases by 63\% compared to the baseline observing strategy, whereas the metric decreases by 79\% for \glspl*{mba} in the \gls*{nes} alone.

	The planned observing strategy for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's \gls*{lsst} has been revised and optimized over the past seven years \citep{SCOC_Report_1,2022ApJS..258....1B, SCOC_Report_2,SCOC_Report_3}. 
 With an expected start date in late 2025, the survey will span ten years, covering $\sim$18,000 square degrees in six broad-band filters ($u$, $g$, $r$, $i$, $z$, and $y$) using the Rubin Observatory \gls*{lsstcam}, with a 9.6 deg$^2$ \gls*{fov} and the 8.36-m Simonyi Survey Telescope. The details of the survey's main science drivers and science requirements are summarized by \cite{lsstScienceBook2009}, \cite{lsstSRD}, \cite{2019ApJ...873..111I}, \cite{2022ApJS..258....1B}, and references within. 
 The planned \gls*{lsst} observing strategy has primarily been assessed via simulations of the observing strategy, in order to determine the expected outcomes over ten years of observations.
 These simulations are generated by the Rubin operations simulator (\rubinsim) that utilizes the Rubin Observatory scheduler (\rubinscheduler), which combines the expected properties and performance of the telescope and camera with the conditions at the observing site using archival weather models for Cerro Pach\'on \citep{2014SPIE.9150E..14C, 2014SPIE.9150E..15D, 2017arXiv170804058L, 2019AJ....157..151N, jones_r_lynne_2020_4048838}.
 The Rubin Metric Analysis Framework \citep[\maf; ][]{2014SPIE.9149E..0BJ} takes a \rubinsim simulation as input and can be used to compute key values for a wide range of science cases which then can be used to compare the performance of various \gls*{lsst} observing strategies.
	
	Previous analyses of the \gls*{lsst} observing strategy  \cite[e.g., ][]{lsstsciencecollaborationScienceDrivenOptimizationLSST2017, 2018Icar..303..181J,  2018arXiv181200515L, 2022ApJS..258....5A, 2022ApJS..263...23G, schwambTuningLegacySurvey2023,2023ApJS..268...11F} have primarily focused on the scientific outcomes based on all data accumulated over the total ten-year duration of the survey. In other words they only consider the cumulative results obtained throughout the survey from the nightly stream of alerts, daily \gls*{rpp}  Data Products, or yearly Data Releases (described in \cite{LSE-163}).  
 When making major decisions about how \gls*{lsst} will be executed (e.g., survey footprint area, distribution of observations between the optical filters, and observing cadence across different sky regions), computing and comparing \maf metrics at the end of the 10 years (e.g., the total number of supernovae, \glspl*{mba}, or galaxies discovered) for \rubinsim cadence simulations is sufficient. 
 This is appropriate because for the majority of the survey, i.e.\ Year 2 onwards, it is expected that the generation of data products will be well described by the survey simulations described above.
 The main difference occurs in Year 1 of Rubin science operations when the survey will cover the sky for the first time and, as such, will not have previous \gls*{lsstcam} images which are required to describe the static background sky. This will impact the real-time discovery and detection of astrophysical transients; e.g., supernovae, variable stars, and moving objects. Further detailed analysis is needed to understand what will be discovered during Year 1 of \gls*{lsst}. 
	
	The nightly \gls*{rpp} pipelines will use difference imaging to find transient sources within each \gls*{lsst} observation, otherwise known as a visit. 
 In difference imaging a template representing the static sky, made through the combination of several past exposures, will be subtracted from an observation, thus creating an image of sources that represent changes relative to the static sky. 
 Within 60\ s of image readout from \gls*{lsstcam} the resulting transient detections will be sent out as world public alerts in the Rubin alert stream \citep{lsstSRD, 2019ApJ...873..111I, LDM-612, LSE-163, RTN-011}. 
 The transient detections will also be fed into the Rubin \gls*{ssp} pipelines in order to discover/recover moving \glspl*{sso}, and report those detections to the \gls*{mpc}  \citep{2019ApJ...873..111I,lsstMOPS,lsstSSP}. 
 % Templates will be created as part the annual Rubin Observatory Data Releases with the \gls*{rpp} pipelines using the most recent templates produced from the previous year's observations for alert production. 
In addition to nightly alerts there will be annual Rubin Observatory Data Releases, where template images are regenerated and all the survey images are reprocessed by the \glspl*{rpp} pipelines for transient detections.
It is expected that each Data Release will have higher quality template images for difference imaging, as the number of images available for templates increases with time.
 
This strategy will not work for Year 1 of \gls*{lsst} when the images required to produce templates are not yet available.  A different approach is needed if astrophysical transients and \glspl*{sso} are going to be found in near real-time during the first year. To this end, the Rubin Data Management System will produce incremental templates as Year 1 of \gls*{lsst} progresses \citep{RTN-011}. % LCR-2273: Construct Image Differencing Templates Outside DRP, new requirement 1.4.6 Template Coadds ID: DMS-REQ-0280, The DMS shall periodically create Template Images in each of the u,g,r,i,z,y passbands.
	The specific requirements, such as the number of observations required and how frequently the relevant data management pipelines will run to generate these Year 1 templates, is still to be decided \citep{SCOC_Report_3}. The selected strategy will have significant implications for which of the Year 1 images can undergo difference imaging in the \gls*{rpp} pipeline \citep{DMTN-107,RTN-011}. 
	In particular, the Rubin \gls*{ssp} pipelines will only be able to search for moving objects on the night the observations are taken if a pre-existing template is available. 
	The detections will not be lost per se, as the Rubin data management pipelines will perform a complete reanalysis of all previous data when creating each annual Data Release, but this will limit the opportunities for immediate time-sensitive follow-up that would have been enabled if the \glspl*{sso} discoveries were announced and preliminary orbits were available in the \gls*{mpc}.
 \cite{2021RNAAS...5..143S} highlights some of the high-impact solar system science enabled by Year 1 \gls*{lsst} incremental template generation, such as the follow-up with ground- and space-based telescopes of \glspl*{iso} passing through the solar system or cometary outbursts. 
	\cite{schwambTuningLegacySurvey2023} examined how the \gls*{lsst} observing strategy parameters can be tuned to improve or benefit solar system science over the ten years of the survey and demonstrated the importance of evaluating various strategies for producing templates in Year 1 of Rubin operations. 
 In recent years, the Rubin Observatory \gls*{scoc} has come to a consensus for the majority of significant observing strategy decisions \citep{SCOC_Report_1, SCOC_Report_2,SCOC_Report_3}. Now we can begin to focus on the expectations for the discovery and characterization of \glspl*{sso} during the first year of the survey and start exploring the trade-offs and benefits of potentially boosting incremental template production in Year 1 of \gls*{lsst}. 
 
 In this work, we investigate the generation of templates during Year 1 of \gls*{lsst} and assess the impact on \gls*{sso} discovery and characterization metrics compared to the nominal \gls*{lsst} cadence simulation \maf metrics  (where the existence of templates is assumed). 
 In Section \ref{sec:methods}, we present our methodology for analysing the \baselinefull Rubin cadence simulation, % to identify which observations have an available generated template corresponding to their location in the sky. 
 in order to identify which visits had an available template image at the time of observation.
 % The output from our technique would allow for the templates to be applied to the observations and generate transient alerts and potentially \gls*{sso} detections. 
 This allows us to create a list of visits in Year 1 that could have been processed by \gls*{rpp} to produce transient alerts, in particular detections of \glspl*{sso}.
 We present our results of this analysis in Section \ref{sec:results} for several different timescales for incremental template generation and summarize our conclusions in Section \ref{sec:summary_conclusions}.  
	
	\section{Methods}
	\label{sec:methods}
	\subsection{Simulated LSST Pointings}
	In order to investigate the effects of incremental template generation, we make use of the Rubin \maf \citep{2014SPIE.9149E..0BJ} and a simulated \gls*{lsst} survey pointing history generated with the \rubinsim operations simulator.
 This uses the \rubinscheduler, with inputs for the predicted performance of the telescope, optics, and \gls*{lsstcam}, alongside site weather models % https://rubin-scheduler.lsst.io/site-models.html
 and values for Cerro Pach{\'o}n's sky brightness \citep{Yoachim2016}.
 In addition, the simulation includes realistic periods of downtime for maintenance and engineering work. 
 The \rubinsim operations simulator and \rubinscheduler are presented and reviewed in detail in \cite{2014SPIE.9150E..14C}, \cite{2014SPIE.9150E..15D}, \cite{2016SPIE.9910E..13D}, \cite{Yoachim2016},  \cite{lsstsciencecollaborationScienceDrivenOptimizationLSST2017},  \cite{2018Icar..303..181J}, \cite{2019AJ....157..151N}, \cite{jones_r_lynne_2020_4048838}, \cite{2022ApJS..258....1B} and references therein.  
 We chose to use the output from the \baselinefull cadence simulation \citep{v4.0sims,SCOC_Report_3} in our analysis. At the time of submission, this simulation was the most accurate representation of how \gls*{lsst} will be conducted, having been refined by the Rubin \gls*{scoc} in consultation with the various \gls*{lsst} science collaborations and Rubin data rights community. 
	The details of the earlier \texttt{baseline\_v3.0\_10yrs} are laid out in \cite{SCOC_Report_2}, where a number of minor adjustments have been incorporated into the survey strategy from previous versions to produce \baselinefull as described in \cite{SCOC_Report_3}. 
    In particular, \baselinefull simulates running the survey with a single exposure or 
    ``snap'' for each visit, whereas previous simulations had assumed that each visit divided into 2  snaps that would be later co-added by the Rubin data management pipelines.
    A single snap reduces the overhead due to image readout, increasing the time available to the survey by $\sim$7-9$\%$ \citep[see Section 3.6 of][]{SCOC_Report_3}. The SCOC has already endorsed switching to the 1 snap per visit observing mode if it is technically feasible after commissioning tests with LSSTCam. The main reason to have two snaps per visit was for aiding in cosmic ray identification and rejection. Today there are several automated methods that can identify cosmic ray strikes in single CCD images \citep[e.g.][]{2000PASP..112..703R, 2001PASP..113.1420V, 2005AN....326..428S, 2018zndo...1482019M}. Thus, we expect that the 1 snap cadence simulation will best represent the survey observing strategy during the LSST's first year on-sky.  
    
    % https://community.lsst.org/t/scientific-impact-of-moving-from-2-snaps-to-a-single-exposure/3266
    % https://pstn-056.lsst.io/PSTN-056.pdf section 3.6 
   
    Full details about the \baselinefull observing cadence is described in \cite{SCOC_Report_3}. We highlight a few of the notable aspects of the observing strategy and changes compared to previous \rubinsim simulations. The \baselinefull includes better (and mostly improved) estimates for the throughput of the optical system with silver instead of the originally planned aluminum mirror coatings. All filters except for $u$ benefit from the switch to silver. Because of the revised throughputs, $g,r,i,z,$ and $y$-band exposures are 29.2s and $u$ exposures were lengthened to 38s, and more visits were shifted to the $u$ filter. The number of $u$-band exposures was increased by 10$\%$ compared to \texttt{baseline\_v3.0\_10yrs} simulation. We note that the gain in observing time from the switch to 2 snap is not available in year 1 of the \baseline simulation, as 8 weeks worth of additional downtime were included in Year 1  to mimic engineering time that is expected to be needed post commissioning \citep{SCOC_Report_3}. The engineering time is more heavily weighted to the start of the survey and tapers off towards the end of Year 1. There is no rolling cadence (where the sky is divided into bands and during ``on'' years the band gets a more concentrated number of visits) implemented in the first year of \baseline due to the need for generating templates across the entire survey footprint for Year 2 operations. The distributions of on-sky visits in Year 1 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:baseline_labels}.   
	
	The \gls*{lsst} is comprised of multiple surveys (see Figure \ref{fig:baseline_labels}) with the largest component being the $\sim$18,000 deg$^2$ \gls*{wfd}; see \cite{SCOC_Report_1}, \cite{2022ApJS..258....1B}, and \cite{SCOC_Report_2} for a detailed description. 
	In this analysis we have excluded any visits associated with the five \glspl*{ddf} or the low-solar elongation twilight survey\footnote{SQL query for the \baselinefull pointing database: \texttt{select * from observations where night<365 and scheduler$\_$note not like "\%DD\%" and scheduler$\_$note not like "\%twilight\%"}}.
	These visits could skew the \maf statistics because these surveys within the \gls*{lsst} footprint follow  observational strategies that differ significantly from the observing strategy of the main \gls*{wfd} survey and the other additional smaller surveys making up \gls*{lsst}; the \gls*{nes} and Dusty (Galactic) Plane, and South Celestial Pole (SCP) mini-surveys. 
 The \gls*{nes} mini-survey observes the sky northward of the \gls*{wfd} footprint, up to +10$^{\circ}$ of the ecliptic in the northern hemisphere sky, in $griz$ filters. We note that the \gls*{nes} is observed with fewer total visits than the \gls*{wfd} observing strategy. 
 \cite{2018arXiv181201149S}, \cite{schwambTuningLegacySurvey2023}, and references within provide a detailed description of the \gls*{nes} and its importance for \gls*{lsst} solar system science. 
	The \glspl*{ddf} have dense temporal coverage over a very localized portion of the sky (one camera pointing, or two in the case of the Euclid \gls*{ddf}) and so any \glspl*{sso} in a \gls*{ddf} would receive many more detections than is representative for the vast majority of \glspl*{sso} imaged in \gls*{lsst}. Similarly, the twilight observations are taken at low-solar elongation in order to find small bodies on orbits interior to the Earth, which translates to camera pointings that are highly constrained on sky and  temporally restricted to when the Sun is between 0 and -12 degree elevation \citep{SCOC_Report_3}. 
	% \textbf{Note that the baseline comparison must also have the DDF/twilight visits removed! Therefore values such as the area covered in the baseline comparison does not include the DDF/twilight fields.} 

    From this point on we shall refer to the Year 1 baseline as \baseline, which is the \baselinefull pointing history with the \gls*{ddf} visits,  low-solar elongation twilight survey, and visits after Year 1 removed. We only consider visits during Year 1 of the survey as after this time an interim incremental template strategy will no longer be necessary; full sky coverage with sufficient quality for template generation is expected to be achieved after Year 1 \citep{RTN-011}.  We take the modified  \baseline simulated pointing history and count the number of visits suitable for generating templates matching our requirements described in Section \ref{sec:ITG}.  We assume that the \gls*{rpp} and \gls*{ssp} pipelines will only generate alerts and solar system detections for areas of the sky with templates, as difference imaging cannot be performed without templates \citep{DMTN-107}. 
 Figure \ref{fig:baseline_skymaps} shows the per filter \baseline simulation's Year 1 visit sky maps that are considered for our analysis of incremental template generation timescales. 
 Figure \ref{animation:baseline} displays a snapshot from an animation showing the nominal sky coverage of $r$-band observations expected over the first year of the survey.

	\subsection{Tracts and Patches}
	\label{sec:tractsandpatches} 
	
	Each night the Rubin scheduler will randomly select a goal \gls*{lsstcam} rotator angle between $-$80$^{\circ}$ and +80$^{\circ}$ for the entire night of observations \citep{v4.0sims}. 
 The scheduler will try to execute observations with position angles as close as possible to the desired angle. Visits to the same pointing within a night will have close but slightly different camera rotator positions. 
 The scheduler will also execute spatial camera dithers between subsequent visits to the same on-sky \gls*{lsst} field \citep{v4.0sims}. 
These spatial and rotational dithers will lead to non-uniform coverage at sub-detector length scales; therefore creation of a template image will not be as simple as selecting a number of images in a given filter at the same field pointing. 
 Due to the shape of the \gls*{lsstcam} footprint, the gaps between charged coupled device (CCD) detectors, and gaps between rafts (groupings of CCDs within \gls*{lsstcam}), the dithering between observations requires that the \gls*{lsst} data management and reduction pipelines reduce non-coadded observations at the individual CCD level. Thus, the creation of image subtraction templates will also be performed on a size scale similar to \gls*{lsstcam} CCDs.
 A similar strategy has been successfully employed in the Subaru Telescope's Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey data reduction pipelines \citep{2018PASJ...70S...5B}. 
 
	
	The \gls*{lsst} data management pipelines divide the sky into an overlapping grid of square 1.6$^{\circ} \times 1.6^{\circ}$ tiles, dubbed ``tracts," which are themselves subdivided into $7 \times 7$ ``patches" \citep[see Figure \ref{fig:tractsandpatches} and][]{2018PASJ...70S...5B, LDM-151}. 
	It takes nine tracts to fully cover a single \gls*{lsstcam} pointing, which spans 3.5 deg$^2$. A single patch is the approximate size of an \gls*{lsstcam} CCD detector with dimensions of 13.7$^{\prime} \times 13.7^{\prime}$. A patch is comprised of 4100$\times$4100 pixels with a pixel scale of 0.2\arcsec per pixel, matching that of \gls*{lsstcam} \citep{2019ApJ...873..111I,LDM-151}, and each patch overlaps by 100 pixels on a side with their neighboring patches.  For a detailed overview of tracts and patches, we refer the reader to the summary paper for the Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 0.2/Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Data Challenge 2 (DC2) \citep{2021ApJS..253...31L}.

	A patch is the smallest unit that will be handled by Rubin data processing pipeline. 
 Template generation and, subsequently, image subtraction will be performed at the patch level. 
 Figure \ref{fig:randompatch} shows an example of the coverage in a single filter for a randomly selected patch chosen from the simulated Data Preview 0.2/DC2 \citep{2021ApJS..253...31L}  Year 1 Data Release image templates. 
 The impact from rotational dithers, spatial dithers, chip gaps, raft gaps, masked pixels at detector edges, and saturated sources can be seen. An \gls*{lsst} patch will therefore not have uniform coverage across all of its pixels. This must be accounted for when estimating the Year 1 incremental template production rates.

	\subsection{\healpix Sky Maps} 
	\label{sec:ITG}
	To (1) track the Year 1 visits in a given area of sky suitable for making an incremental template and (2) to identify which observations have sufficient template coverage to produce alerts and solar system detections in Year 1, we partition the sky using a \healpix map \citep[Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization\footnote{\url{http://healpix.sourceforge.net}}; ][]{2005ApJ...622..759G} as shown in Figures \ref{fig:baseline_labels} \& \ref{fig:baseline_skymaps}.
    This pixelisation produces subdivisions of a spherical surface in which each pixel, which we refer to as a healpixel, covers the same surface area. 
%    \textbf{fix here} using an \verb|nside| factor that determines the resolution of each healpixel. 
 The resolution of the \healpix map is determined by \nside, such that the whole sky is divided into $12\times \verb|nside|^2$ healpixels.
 It is too computationally expensive to consider incremental template generation at the individual patch pixel level as each patch has 16,810,000 pixels. 
 Our best compromise is to instead focus on the patch as our smallest size element and use $\texttt{nside}=256$. This results in healpixels with a resolution of approximately $13.7\ \si{arcminutes}$ which is comparable in angular size to a patch. % 13.741946 arcmin  
	We note that this results in a \healpix sky map grid that is similar to, but not exactly aligned with, the patch/tract tessellation that the Rubin Observatory Data Management pipelines are using.  
 By using a healpixel resolution comparable to the patch size, we on average balance the problems of oversampling (large \nside, high resolution healpixels) and undersampling (small \nside, low resolution healpixels) when making our \healpix incremental template coverage sky maps.
	
	\subsection{Year 1 Template Generation Timescales}
	\label{sec:timescales}
	As Year 1 of the survey progresses and images are taken according to the predefined survey strategy, sky coverage increases nightly. 
 However, for operational reasons (such as constraints on staffing and computational resources)  template production is unlikely to occur nightly, but instead only on certain nights with some timescale (e.g.\ days to weeks). 
 Template generation timescales have not yet been finalized by the Rubin Observatory Operations and Data Management Teams, but they are planning for a regular schedule (e.g. approximately monthly) \citep{DMTN-107,RTN-011}. 
 We therefore explore a range of template generation timescales, $\Delta t$ =  3, 7, 14, and 28 day intervals from the start of the \baseline simulation. 
	
	\subsection{Requirements for Incremental Template Production}
	The individual image requirements and total number of observations needed to make suitable Year 1 templates in each filter has not yet been finalized by the Rubin Observatory Data Management Team \citep{DMTN-107,RTN-011}. 
 On-sky tests with the commissioning camera (ComCam) and \gls*{lsstcam} are needed. 
 ComCam was installed in August 2024, and the first photons were captured in October 2024. 
 At the time of this paper's submission, \gls*{lsstcam} on-sky commissioning is expected to start in Spring 2025\footnote{The latest Rubin Observatory construction milestone schedule can be found at \url{https://www.lsst.org/about/project-status}}. 
 In the meantime, we can make some reasonable assumptions based on the expected performance of the telescope and camera system. 
 There are benefits and trade-offs to balance for the image requirements applied to Year 1 template generation. This study is a first step in understanding the impact of incremental template generation,  so we elect to use very broad requirements for image quality based on the simulated seeing and depth of each visit in \baseline. 
 Further work will be needed to explore the full phase space of image requirements to optimize \gls*{lsst} Year 1 template building. 
	
	\subsubsection{Image Seeing and Depth Constraints}
	\label{sec:imageqa}
	Not every \gls*{lsst} observation taken in the first year of science operations should be combined to produce an image subtraction template. 
 Observations taken in  poor seeing and/or bad photometic conditions should ideally be excluded to minimise the number of artifacts in difference images. 
	On the other hand, if image quality constraints are too restrictive then very few observations will meet our requirements making templates even scarcer in Year 1.  
	Using the values per visit reported in the \baseline pointing database generated by \rubinsim, we evaluate the seeing quality using the ``effective” \gls*{fwhm}, which is the \gls*{fwhm} of a single Gaussian describing the \gls*{psf}, and image depth from the 5-$\sigma$ limiting magnitude\footnote{In \baseline these are the fields \texttt{seeingFwhmEff} and \texttt{fiveSigmaDepth} respectively}. 
	We have not directly included airmass constraints on incremental template generation. 
 We also set no minimum time threshold between suitable images as \gls*{ssp} only attempts to link sources that have moved within a single observing night, so most \glspl*{sso} would be expected to move sufficiently far on the sky between the template building observations and future observations of the field to be able to be identified as transient sources by the Rubin image subtraction pipelines after the template is available.
 This may lead to contamination of the template images by slow moving sources, such as distant outer \glspl*{sso}.
	
	We impose broad image quality constraints to exclude the observations with the worst seeing and limiting magnitude. 
    Visits of sufficient quality must all have their seeing within a given ratio, and the limiting magnitudes within a given range.
 Each filter is evaluated separately, as each filter has different expected image depth and seeing distributions, as shown in Tables \ref{tab:year1_image_seeing} and  \ref{tab:year1_image_depth}. 
	For a given healpix, filter $f$, and date in the survey, we look at all the relevant observations taken up to that point and  every observation $j$ that matches the following criteria will be considered to build the Year 1 template at that healpixel location: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item seeing of frame $j$ /\texttt{min}(seeing of all available observations in filter $f$) $<$ 2
		\item (\texttt{max}(5-$\sigma$ limiting magnitude of all available observations in filter $f$) -  5-$\sigma$ limiting magnitude of frame $j$)$<$ 0.5
	\end{enumerate}
	This will reject the lowest quality images on average. There is a chance a healpixel gets unlucky, and all the observations taken up to that date are poor quality. In that case, if the seeing and depths do not vary significantly between the exposures, a Year 1 template would still be produced for that healpix. We examine the quality of the templates produced in our simulation in Section \ref{sec:results}.
	
	%When generating templates in a given filter we select all visits that span a given healpixel and separate these visits into possible template/science images as described further in section \ref{sec:tracking_incremental_template_generation}.
	%We consider the seeing of these possible template images (\texttt{seeingFwhmEff}) and by divide by the benchmark seeing (the minimum seeing value; i.e.\ the least atmospheric distortion) of those images for this healpixel.
	%Only images with seeing within a factor \texttt{seeing ratio} = 2 of the benchmark are considered for template generation.
	%We then account for variation in the 5-$\sigma$ limiting magnitude depth of the possible template images, e.g.\ due to observations near the moon/giant planets with high sky brightness. \textbf{and cloudy images?}
	%The benchmark depth is the highest value (i.e.\ faintest magnitude) of the template images available for that healpixel in the given filter.
	%Images that have a \texttt{fiveSigmaDepth} which is brighter than the benchmark by \texttt{fiveSigmaDepth range} = 0.5 mag are not considered for template generation.
	%For reference we provide statistics on the seeing and depth of all \baseline visits (by filter) in Tables \ref{tab:year1_image_seeing} \& \ref{tab:year1_image_depth}.
	%It is particularly important to consider image quality for each filter separately, given the variation in typical depth and seeing for observations in different filters.
	%We note that we have not considered other constraints on template images such as a maximum airmass or a minimum time between images (e.g.\ slow moving Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) may be present in templates within insufficient time gaps).
	%We have selected only basic constraints and have left detailed consideration of the effects of image quality on template creation to other work \textbf{(cite Eric's work?)}.
	%\textbf{We have recorded the mean seeing, mean depth and number of visits used to generate templates for each healpixel. Our constraints result in template images with seeing/depth typical for Year 1visits in that filter? ADD HISTOGRAMS. Emphasise the on-the-fly nature of image quality requirements - image quality constraint varies for each healpixel. We could make a bad template if all available images are trash but the scheduler is generally good - see histograms.
		%Note we don't consider the template quality after generation for the SSO \maf metrics - source artifacts can be dealt with by SSP pipeline (heliolinc) linking.}

	\subsubsection{Number of Suitable Observations Used to Build a Year 1 Template}
	\label{sec:num_images}
	We also need to decide the minimum number of observations meeting our quality assurance criteria (described in Section \ref{sec:imageqa}) that should be combined to produce the Year 1 incremental templates at the patch level.  
 When considering healpixels with comparable angular size to patches, we note that there will be some cases when the overlap of images that lie within a given healpixel will not fill 100\% of the area (see the discussion in Section \ref{sec:tractsandpatches}), and the counted number of visits suitable for generating a template will be slightly overestimated or underestimated. 
 We expect that across many healpixels these effects will on average balance out. 
 We can also help mitigate this effect by picking a reasonable threshold for the number of suitable observations that must overlap with a patch (our sky map healpixel) to build a template such that at least 80-90$\%$ of the patch is covered. 
 Recent Rubin Observatory technical notes propose that 3 good quality observations might be sufficient for producing template images \citep{DMTN-107,RTN-011}. 
 The majority of the randomly selected DP0.2/DC2 patch in Figure \ref{fig:randompatch} is covered by at least 5 observations with more than $\sim$80$\%$ of the patch having at least 4 observations in coverage. 
 We therefore add one more observation beyond the minimum proposed in \cite{DMTN-107} and \cite{RTN-011} and require 4 Year 1 observations per patch per filter that meet or exceed our seeing and image depth thresholds to ensure successful template building.
		
		% See Lynne's figure in slack channel 16/08/2022, saved in this dir as lynne_image.png
		% make a figure with a \nside = 256 healpixel plotted over lynne's very high resolution image
		% One will be able to see the variation of total counts within that the \nside = 256 pixel
		%Vice versa, there may be cases where we have underestimated the number of images available for template generation within a particular however we expect that across many healpixels and over the course of Year 1 these effects will on average balance out. % think through how an underestimate comes up, see Mario post in slack
		%Furthermore, we note that our healpixel grid does not exactly align with the Rubin Observatory fixed sky map of patches.
		%However by using a healpixel resolution comparable to the patch size we on average balance the problems of oversampling (large nside, high resolution healpixels) and undersampling (small nside, low resolution healpixels) when assessing the various survey metrics.
		%Oversampling would overestimate the template area as we are assessing healpixels much smaller than the patches that the data processing pipeline will operate on.
		%Likewise undersampling leads to an underestimate of template coverage as smaller areas within the healpixels may have sufficient coverage for template generation.
		
		\subsection{Tracking Incremental Template Generation}
		\label{sec:tracking_incremental_template_generation}
		
		We step through the Year 1 simulated \rubinsim \baseline pointing database in $\Delta t$ time intervals. 
  At each template building session, $n$, we use \maf to iterate over all healpixels in our sky map and each of the six \gls*{lsst} filters, selecting all visits that span a given healpixel and separating these visits into possible template building or science observations. 
  We define $t_n$ as a date on which incremental templates are generated:
		\begin{equation}
			t_n= t_0+ \Delta t\cdot n
		\end{equation}
		where $t_0$ is the survey start date. 
  In this analysis we investigated values of $\Delta t$ = 3, 7, 14, and  28 days (see Section \ref{sec:timescales}).
  Templates must be created separately for each filter. 
  As such, for each healpixel (aka patch) we select all overlapping visits in a given filter with visit exposure time $t \leq t_n$. 
  % I.e. we consider only visits taken before the template generation date $t_n$.
  We assume that templates were last generated on date $t_{n-1}$, therefore we divide all visits into possible template images ($t < t_{n-1}$) and science images ($t_{n-1}< t \leq t_n$).
For the possible template images we select only the visits that match our image quality criteria (see Section \ref{sec:imageqa}). 
  If at least four images (see Section \ref{sec:num_images}) fitting these criteria are overlapping the healpixel, then the template for that healpixel is assumed to have been generated at $t_{n-1}$.
  
In this case all subsequent visits to that healpixel ($t_{n-1}< t \leq t_n$) are assumed to have been successfully processed by the \gls*{rpp} and \gls*{ssp} pipelines and to have generated alerts and can be counted when assessing any metrics.
If the template was not generated at $t_{n-1}$ then all subsequent visits to that healpixel are assumed to have not been processed and they are discounted when assessing metrics.
  % \textbf{We then flag in our tracking database that the template has now been made at $t_n$ for that healpixel and filter combination}, and record the number of nights since the first visit to the field which we will refer to as \deltaNight. 		
We note that some healpixels may have $>4$ suitable observations available by the time of template generation and would likely have better depth/seeing and so be of higher quality. 
  We do not adjust the 5-$\sigma$ limiting magnitude of an \gls*{lsst} observation based on the properties of its associated healpixels' templates. 
If the majority of the healpixel templates go to a much shallower depth than the observation it is subtracted from, there will be many bogus transient detections in addition to the real transient astrophysical sources and moving \glspl*{sso}. 
% We expect that  the \gls*{ssp} algorithms will be able to handle this, and that these extra bogus transient detections will not pollute significantly \gls*{ssp}'s moving object discoveries due to the constraint that the tracklets must be consistent with a heliocentric orbit over multiple days. 
In principle the \gls*{ssp} linking algorithms, namely \heliolinc\footnote{\url{https://github.com/lsst-dm/heliolinc2}}, should be able to match detections over a period of days to weeks and filter out those that are inconsistent with the Keplerian motion across the sky exhibited by a genuine \gls*{sso} \citep{holmanHelioLinCNovelApproach2018,heinze2022}.
% see: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023DPS....5540503H/abstract
% see: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022DPS....5450404H/abstract
The number of random false positive detections that could be combined in such a way to produce a decent heliocentric orbit fit, should be quite low, however, we acknowledge that the presence of bogus detections could complicate identification of genuine \glspl*{sso}. 
		
		% \textbf{N.B. we have considered just the visits within one healpixel but we keep the whole visit in our database, which could span several healpixels?}
		% The same visit would appear across several healpixels and would be removed/added to the database depending on the whether the healpixel had a template or not.
		% need to record the available visits for each healpixel? Keep a whole visit if >90% of its healpixels have templates?
		% Run the required metrics on the healpixels within the function, similar to Lynne
		% OR we run ``remove_no_templates" on a dataslice so the tests are calculated per healpixel but we record ``valid_ids" which is the unique number of ids.
		% Try keep all ids and count the number of times each visit appears. Multiply the counts by healpixel area to get template coverage of whole visit.
		
		
		\subsection{Applying \maf Metrics}
  \label{sec:applying_maf_metrics}
		
		At this stage we are able to use \maf to run various metrics directly on the healpixels covering observations that had templates available. 
Given our methodology described above, we are assessing metrics on all observations up to date $t_n$, where $t_{n-1}$ was the last time templates were generated.
Thus with each time step in our simulation we are effectively recording metrics for the periods of time $t_{n-1} < t < t_{n}$.
As such, to get the final results for total number of visits per healpixel in Year 1 we must sum the values of \maf's \reduceCount metric, which were recorded at every $t_n$.
We have also recorded the number of nights between template generation and the first visit to the healpixel, which we will refer to as \deltaNight.
In this case, to determine the first night on which a template was available we must take the minimum metric value for all $t_n$. 
% We also calculate the fractional template coverage of each visit (see Section \ref{sec:template_coverage}) by dividing the total visit healpixel area with templates by the LSSTCam sky coverage (9.6 deg$^2$). 
		
		
		We also need to look beyond the individual healpixel (patch) level to the coverage at the \gls*{lsstcam} \gls*{fov} scale. 
  At \texttt{nside} = 256, each visit contains $\sim$183 healpixels.
  If only a few patches in a given \gls*{lsst} exposure are able to be image subtracted then we expect moving object discoveries to be missed across most or all of the frame. 
  This is because the \gls*{ssp} detection algorithm requires nightly tracklets for  discovery; these are potential linkages from linear extrapolation using detections from two different observations of the same field in a single night \citep{lsstMOPS,lsstSSP}.  
  \gls*{ssp} then takes the tracklets from the last 15 nights, and attempts to associate 3 tracklets onto a heliocentric orbit in order to identify new \glspl*{sso} \citep{kubica2007,lsstMOPS,lsstSSP}. 
  As such each visit must have reasonable template coverage to have good chances of detecting the moving object over the days - weeks required for \gls*{ssp} linkage.
  To this end, whilst simulating template generation as described above, \maf was used to count the number of constituent healpixels within each visit in the period $t_{n-1} < t < t_n$ that already had a template at $t_{n-1}$.
  From the number of template healpixels we calculated the fractional template coverage of each visit (see Section \ref{sec:template_coverage}) assuming an \gls*{lsstcam} \gls*{fov} of 9.6 deg$^2$ and healpixel area of $5.25\e{-2}\ \mathrm{deg}^2$ for \texttt{nside} = 256.
  % This value is stored as an additional column in the \baseline pointing database.
  For discovering and characterizing \glspl*{sso}, we only run solar system \maf metrics on observations where the majority of the image area is available for template generation. For this study, we create a redacted  \baseline pointing database, where visits with $<$ 90$\%$ template coverage have been removed, and use this to calculate a subset of \maf solar system metrics.  We discuss the validity of selecting a threshold value of 90$\%$  template coverage in Section \ref{sec:template_coverage}.
  

\maf is able to calculate a wide range of metrics related to solar system science, in order to evaluate the performance of the planned \gls*{lsst} observing cadence and the impact of tuning various survey strategy parameters in the Rubin scheduler. The detailed methodology for how the solar system metrics are calculated is described in \cite{schwambTuningLegacySurvey2023}; we provide a brief overview here. 
Using the \texttt{movingObjects} module within \maf, a subsample of orbits are selected from a particular small body model population. 
Each orbit is then cloned for a range of absolute magnitude ($H$) bins, and broad-band colors appropriate for the population are assigned. 
For each synthetic small body, ephemerides are generated and used to determine in which of the simulated \gls*{lsst} observations will the ``object" be positioned within the camera footprint, if any. 
For those objects within an observation's \gls*{lsstcam} \gls*{fov}, the apparent magnitude is calculated and combined with other relevant information about the visit stored in the \rubinsim simulated pointing database to determine whether the synthetic object would be bright enough for the \gls*{rpp} pipelines to detect. 
Using this data \maf can calculate the fraction of successfully detected simulated objects in a given absolute magnitude bin that meets a specific metric criteria, which depend on the number and cadence of observations, coverage in certain filters, etc. 
We can then examine the change in these calculated metrics relative to another \rubinsim cadence simulation and use that output as a proxy to understand the impact of observing strategy changes on the discoverability and characterization of the simulated small body population.  


To assess variations of the \gls*{lsst} observing strategy over the full 10 year survey, \cite{schwambTuningLegacySurvey2023} primarily used three sets of metrics (discovery, light-curve, and color light-curve) that represent the top scientific priorities of the \gls*{lsst} \gls*{sssc}, reflected in their Science Roadmap \citep{2018arXiv180201783S}, namely orbit characterization, surface color/composition study, and rotational light-curve analysis. 
When focusing on Year 1 and the impact of different template building strategies, it is not necessarily informative to apply the exact same metrics used to evaluate the entire \gls*{lsst} performance when the number of visits is one tenth of the full survey. 
Across most of the \gls*{lsst} footprint, the light-curve and color light-curve metrics applied in \cite{schwambTuningLegacySurvey2023} require more observations than will be available in Year 1, but the criteria to discover new \glspl*{sso} is the same in Year 1 as as it is expected to be in Year 10 of the \gls*{lsst}. 
Therefore, we apply the same discovery \maf metric applied in \cite{schwambTuningLegacySurvey2023} which examines which of the simulated objects meet the \gls*{ssp} detection criteria, i.e.\ 3 nightly pairs of observations within 15 days, but we do not focus on the same light-curve and color light-curve metrics for this work. 
% Instead, we have selected a different metric to explore the availability of early broad-band color estimates in Year 1 with varying template building timescales. 
Instead, we choose a color metric that uses the fraction of objects that have 10 \gls*{snr} weighted detections per filter in four filters from the set of $grizy$\footnote{$u$-band observations are not considered as most \glspl*{sso} are faint at this wavelength \citep[e.g.;][]{2013Icar..226..723D,2008ssbn.book..181F}, and the planned number of $u$-band visits are low compared to the other filters \citep{SCOC_Report_3}}. 
This allows us to get an estimate of how many objects have good surface color estimates and absolute magnitudes in Year 1. 
This is because broad-band optical colors have been previously used to divide asteroids observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Moving Object Catalog \citep{2001AJ....122.2749I,2002AJ....124.2943I,juricComparisonPositionsMagnitudes2002} into surface taxonomies \citep{2013Icar..226..723D,sergeyevMillionAsteroidObservations2021}. 
In this metric an object is considered to have a reliable absolute magnitude and phase function in a given filter if it is detected in that filter with at least 10 \gls*{snr}-weighted observations. 
For the $n$ observations of a small body in a given filter, the number of \gls*{snr}-weighted observations ($N_w$) is calculated as a weighted sum where:
\begin{equation}
	N_w =  \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\texttt{min}(\mathrm{SNR}_i, 20)}{20}
\end{equation}
This formulation means that observations with \gls*{snr} $\ge$20 contribute to the sum with a weight of 1.
Observations with \gls*{snr} $<20$ can be used, but then $n>10$ observations will be required to determine a reliable colour.

We chose to calculate the Year 1 \gls*{sso} metrics for the main solar system populations: the \glsreset{pha}\glspl*{pha}, \glsreset{neo}\glspl*{neo}, \glsreset{mba}\glspl*{mba}, \glsreset{tno}\glspl*{tno}, and \glsreset{occ}\glspl*{occ} used and described in \cite{schwambTuningLegacySurvey2023}. 
% The model orbital distributions are described in \cite{schwambTuningLegacySurvey2023}. 
We note that the \glspl*{occ} are divided into two subgroups: distant comets with perihelion ($q$) $\le$ 20\ au (labeled as \occrtwenty) and those that come in closer to the Sun with $q \le$ 5\ au (labeled as \occrfive). % OCC_r20 and OCC_r5
Given the small numbers of Jupiter Trojans and \textquotesingle Ayl\'{o}\textquotesingle chaxnims \citep[Inner Venus objects;][]{bolinDiscoveryCharacterizationKilometre2022,2025Icar..42516333B} expected to be discovered in Year 1, we do not include them in our analysis. 
For both the discovery and color metrics, we calculate two values for each population: one that samples the larger (brighter) objects in the population, and one for sampling the smaller (fainter) objects in the pipeline, tailoring the $H$ thresholds to the value most representative for the given population. 
The full list of \maf metrics used in this work are presented in Table \ref{tab:metrics}. 
Given the apparent magnitude distribution of the \glspl*{tno} and the small subset of objects simulated for the \maf metrics calculations, the value of the color metric is expected to be 0 in the first year for outer solar system objects. 
Therefore we calculate this metric only for the Inner Solar System populations: the \glspl*{neo}, \glspl*{pha}, and \glspl*{mba}.

		For each of our template generation timescales ($\Delta t =$ 3, 7, 14, and 28 days), we analyze both the survey template coverage at the healpixel scale and the redacted Year 1 visit database described in Section \ref{sec:applying_maf_metrics}, calculating relevant statistics and \maf metrics. 
  % In this analysis we focus primarily on the results for $\Delta t$ = 7, 28d.
  As an overview, one can consider Figures \ref{fig:template_skymaps_tscale-7} and  \ref{fig:template_skymaps_tscale-28}, which show sky map distributions of visits in each filter for $\Delta t = 7$ \& $28$ days respectively.

		\subsection{Template Quality and Number of Observations Used in Template Production}
		
		In Figure \ref{fig:template_image_histograms_tscale} and its accompanying online figure set, we plot, per filter, a histogram of the number of observations used to build each template and the resulting distribution of mean limiting magnitudes and the mean observed seeing values that were used to produce each of the incremental templates per healpixel. 
  At the healpixel level, our template generation algorithm only produces a template each generation time step if there are at least four or more images with consistent quality and a template had not been previously generated on an earlier day. 
  We find that, across all time steps we tested, the majority of templates are created with four or five observations. 
  This is highlighted further in Figure \ref{fig:template_skymaps_delta-7_28days}, which shows the difference in number of visits between \baseline and the $\Delta t = 7, 28$ day simulations as a series of sky maps (Figures \ref{fig:baseline_skymaps}, \ref{fig:template_skymaps_tscale-7} and \ref{fig:template_skymaps_tscale-28} respectively).
  Most of these ``missing'' visits were used to create template images (Section \ref{sec:template_coverage}).
  At longer template generation time scales, $\Delta t$, an increasing number of templates are created from  $>$ 4 observations given that more images are available due to longer gaps between template building dates. 
  Overall, the distributions of mean seeing and mean image depth are consistent across all $\Delta t$, and are comparable to the expected image quality statistics in the Year 1 baseline survey (see Tables \ref{tab:year1_image_seeing} and \ref{tab:year1_image_depth}). 
  These results are not necessarily surprising given the Rubin scheduler is designed to choose a visit's filter based in part on the observing conditions, in order to ensure the science requirements for image quality per filter in individual and co-added observations are met \citep{lsstSRD}. 
  We have applied very broad requirements on template image quality for this study. 
  We expect that implementing more stringent thresholds on image quality would lead to greater differences in template quality as a function of $\Delta t$.
  Furthermore, we would expect template coverage to increase at a lower rate as more time is needed to collect high quality images (as considered further in Section \ref{sec:template_coverage}).
This analysis shows that, on average, building templates as soon as the images are available uses images with mean seeing and depth comparable to the  expected Year 1 image quality.
We have assumed these template images will enable \gls*{rpp} and \gls*{ssp} to produce solar system discoveries and alerts, however, further investigation into the quality of observations required for suitable incremental templates is needed.

		\subsection{On-Sky Template Coverage}
		\label{sec:template_coverage}
		
		Our analysis shows that the requirements of template generation during Year 1 of \gls*{lsst} reduces the number of visits, and area of the sky, with which detections can be made via difference imaging.
This is shown in Figures \ref{fig:template_skymaps_tscale-7} and  \ref{fig:template_skymaps_tscale-28}, which are a series of sky maps showing the number of visits with templates for each filter, at the end of Year 1 in the $\Delta t = 7, 28$ day simulations, respectively.
In comparison to the baseline scenario shown in Figure \ref{fig:baseline_skymaps}, the number of visits is reduced, and for areas of sky not covered by the \gls*{wfd} cadence, the coverage is noticeably less uniform.
The fractional coverage of the survey footprint at the end of Year 1 for each filter and $\Delta t$ is given in Table \ref{tab:year1_unique_coverage_templates}.
This is summarised in Figures 
\ref{fig:template_skymaps_delta-7_28days}, \ref{fig:template_baseline_all} and \ref{fig:template_baseline_histograms7_28d}, which show how the numbers of visits with templates changes relative to \baseline.
On average, there is a shift of $\gtrsim4$ visits, which were required to make the templates, but this is somewhat larger for the $u$ and $g$ filters in particular.
Altogether these results show that the loss of visits due to template generation depends strongly on the filter and area of sky being considered.

We investigate the dependence of template generation on sky region and filter further by examining selected areas of the sky in more detail.
In Figure \ref{fig:all_together_r_7d} we show sky maps for the \baseline and $\Delta t  =7$ day simulations, and the difference between the two, in both the $g$ and $r$ filters. 
We highlight the locations representative of the nominal \gls*{wfd} cadence, and also the \gls*{nes} and \gls*{gp} which are scheduled to receive a smaller number of visits.
Cutouts of these regions are shown in Figures \ref{fig:skymap_cutouts_g_7} and \ref{fig:skymap_cutouts_r_7} for the $g$ and $r$ filters respectively.
It is clear that, for both filters, the coverage in the \gls*{nes} and \gls*{gp} is less-uniform compared to the \gls*{wfd} when template generation is required.
This effect is more extreme for the $g$ filter compared to the $r$ filter.

  We also consider the number of visits with templates as a function of survey time.
		This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cum_baseline_filter}, where we have plotted the cumulative sky area with templates as determined on a healpixel basis using the \maf metric (\verb|reduceCount|) described in Section \ref{sec:methods}.
		We could not consider the number of visits with templates directly; each visit contains multiple healpixels ($\sim$183 for \texttt{nside} = 256) and not all healpixels within a visit necessarily have templates due to the overlap of previous dithered visits (Figures \ref{fig:randompatch} and \ref{fig:fractional_template_coverage}). % add Lynne high res snapshot figure?
		% reorder figures to get fig:fractional_template_coverage in numerical order?
		In Figure \ref{fig:cum_baseline_filter} the cumulative healpixel area is the non-unique area with templates, i.e.\ we have summed the area with templates for each visit. 		
  % Jamie Note: fraction of the TOTAL baseline survey area (area includes repeat observations, i.e. equivalent to total number of observations)
		Therefore this parameter is closely related to the number of visits with templates (if one were to account for the changing fractional template area per visit, Figure \ref{fig:fractional_template_coverage}).
		We have considered each filter separately and included the cumulative healpixel area that would have been covered in the baseline simulation if templates existed for the full sky (black curve in Figure \ref{fig:cum_baseline_filter}).
		All filters lag behind the baseline with a time delay of approximately 50 days before template coverage begins to increase significantly and alerts start to flow.
  Due to this lag, and the loss of observations required for template building, the $rizy$ filters only reach $64-69\%$ of the baseline area for a 3 day template generation timescale.
		The $u$ and $g$ filters achieve noticeably lower cumulative healpixel areas than the other filters ($26\%$ and $42\%$ respectively for $\Delta t = 3\ \si{d}$).
		We note that as the template generation timescale is increased the cumulative healpixel area also decreases, with some filters experiencing greater decreases than others.
		The cumulative healpixel area for filters $uizy$ decreases by $4-6\%$ as $\Delta t = 3 \rightarrow 28\ \si{d}$, whereas the drop for filters $g$ and $r$ is larger at $7 - 9 \%$. % see df_coverage

		This implies that the observing strategy for the $u$ and $g$ filters in \baseline is more sensitive to the delays incurred when template generation is accounted for.

  Altogether this analysis shows that the filters and sky areas that are scheduled to receive lower number of visits in the \baseline schedule are the most negatively affected by template generation across all timescales.
  This is particularly true for the $u$ and $g$ filters and the \gls*{nes} and \gls*{gp} regions of the sky.
  The removal of $\geq4$ visits for template generation in these filters/regions is a greater fractional loss compared to parts of \baseline with larger numbers of visits scheduled in Year 1, such as the \gls*{wfd} areas.
		Overall, the decrease in the number of visits and survey coverage when template generation is considered (Figures \ref{fig:cum_baseline_filter} and \ref{fig:cumFrac_baseline}) implies that there will be a corresponding reduction in the number of transient detections in the prompt data products (including alerts of high priority targets, e.g.\ solar system \glspl*{pha} and \glspl*{iso}) during Year 1 of \gls*{lsst}.
  We investigate this further in Section \ref{sec:sso_metrics}.

		The need to accumulate sufficient past visits to generate templates will naturally introduce a time delay to when difference image detections start to appear in the \gls*{lsst} alert stream.
		This time delay is captured by the \maf \deltaNight metric described in Section \ref{sec:applying_maf_metrics}, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:cumFrac_deltaNight}.
		This metric measures the number of nights between the first visit (in a given filter) to a particular healpixel and the night on which its template (in that filter) was generated.
  Rather than the previous analysis of considering on what night of the survey a given healpixel had a template, this metric describes how long it takes to build a template once that particular healpixel is observable by the survey.
		This therefore removes the bias of which area of the sky is the current focus of the survey. %, e.g.\ the WFD will tend to prioritise visits at low airmass and so preferentially images the sky directly overhead which will change over time \textbf{(see lynne animation \texttt{baseline\_v3.2\_10yrs\_first})}.
Figure \ref{fig:cumFrac_deltaNight} shows that as $\Delta t$ is decreased, the time delay to create a template is also decreased.
		In this figure the cumulative fraction of footprint area refers to the unique on-sky area planned for Year 1 of the survey in that filter; therefore the figure indicates the rate at which the template coverage increases.
		The \deltaNight metric in Figure \ref{fig:cumFrac_deltaNight} is more closely modulated by the choice of $\Delta t$ than the \reduceCount metric in Figure \ref{fig:cum_baseline_filter}, this is particularly clear for the $u$ filter results. % where the scheduling of $u$ visits interacts with the template generation timescale. Compare to step-like function in figure 19.
		% As $\Delta t$ is increased from $3 \rightarrow 28\ \si{d}$ the time between first visit and template generation increases from \red{$5 \rightarrow 27\ \si{d}$ for $25\%$} of the footprint area.
		Across all filters, the differences between different $\Delta t$ are most pronounced for low values of \deltaNight when it is less likely for there to be sufficient re-visits to a given field to generate templates. 
		As \deltaNight$\rightarrow 90\ \si{days}$ all filters have started to converge and we see that up to $\sim 90\%$ of each filter's survey footprint has templates, as $90\ \si{days}$ is several times greater than any $\Delta t$ considered here. 
  Furthermore, on timescales $>90$ days a given region of sky moves out of observability by the survey.
  Therefore this region will not get more opportunities for template images to be taken until it rises again next year. 
		% Lynne on slack: The g band lag .. maybe also related to bright time influencing the cadence? We pair g band with u band images as well as r band images, and it's fairly blue, so we do tend to take more g band visits near dark time. There are also just fewer g band visits. Looking at the distribution on the sky, it does look a bit like dark time / bright time kinds of things to me.

		As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:applying_maf_metrics}, the on-sky extent of each visit will lie across multiple healpixels over which the \maf metrics are being calculated.
		% For example at a resolution of \nside = 256 a LSST visit of 9.6 square degrees will cover approximately 183 healpixels.
		Not all healpixels within a visit footprint will necessarily have a template at the time of exposure, due to the dithering/rotation of past exposures.
		Therefore, as described in Section \ref{sec:applying_maf_metrics}, we recorded the number of constituent healpixels with templates for each visit.
		Figure \ref{fig:fractional_template_coverage} shows a histogram of the fractional template coverage for all visits in Year 1 of \baseline.
		The large spike at zero indicates the visits that had absolutely no template coverage and so could not have generated any alerts.
  The majority of these visits were subsequently used to make templates; we estimate the total number of Year 1 visits used for template generation in Table \ref{tab:year1_N_visits_templates}.
Figure \ref{fig:fractional_template_coverage} demonstrates that the number of visits with template coverage $\geq90\%$ increases with more frequent template generation.
For $\Delta t = 28$ d, $38.8\%$ of Year 1 visits have template coverage $\geq90\%$; this increases to $43.6\%$ for $\Delta t = 3$ d.
		Note that the small number of visits with coverage $>100\%$ arises due to healpixels which include only part of the visit footprint; the footprint does not align perfectly with the healpixel grid and we may overestimate area due to healpixel resolution.
  To justify our selection of a $90\%$ template coverage threshold we present how the distribution shown in Figure \ref{fig:fractional_template_coverage} changes as a function of time (Figure \ref{fig:fractional_template_coverage-2d}).
  This figure shows that throughout most of Year 1 there is an approximate bimodal distribution between visits with 0 and 90\% template coverage.
  Therefore if we were to reduce the 90\% threshold in our analysis we would not include significantly more visits, and such low coverage visits would be less useful for moving object discovery (see Section \ref{sec:sso_metrics} for further discussion).

		\subsection{Solar System Discovery and Color Metrics}
		\label{sec:sso_metrics}
		    For those observations that have sufficient template coverage at the time of the exposure, we can analyse the Year 1 \gls*{sso} metrics, considering only visits that had a fractional template coverage of $\geq 90 \%$, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:template_coverage} above.	
		Figure \ref{fig:temp_gen_discovery_metrics} shows the results for the discovery metric of objects with 3 pairs of detections over a 15 night period.
		We have considered a range of dynamical populations: \glspl*{mba}, \glspl*{neo}, \glspl*{pha}, \glspl*{tno} and \glspl*{occ}, with maximum perihelion distance of 5 au (\occrfive) and 20 au (\occrtwenty).
  The different orbits and physical properties of these distinct populations have a strong influence on discovery and characterisation.
  Furthermore we have considered a ``bright'' and ``faint'' component of each dynamical population (Section \ref{sec:applying_maf_metrics} \& Table \ref{tab:metrics}) in order to assess the effects for large and small \glspl*{sso} separately.
		Each test population consists of 5000 objects randomly sampled from an appropriate synthetic population \cite[see Section 2.2 of][for more details of these simulated \glspl*{sso}]{schwambTuningLegacySurvey2023}.
		We present the metric results of each template generation timescale relative to the default \baseline cadence simulation where the presence of templates is implicitly assumed (i.e.\ all visits are capable of making \gls*{sso} detections and alerts).
  Figure \ref{fig:temp_gen_discovery_metrics} shows that any form of template generation will strongly impact discovery in Year 1, with decreases of 10s of percent.
Discovery of faint objects is more strongly affected; fainter objects are observed with lower \gls*{snr}, so there are fewer possible detections in the baseline.
There is a larger fractional loss of detections due to a lack of templates compared to the bright population.
  Furthermore there are large differences in discovery between different \gls*{sso} populations such as the \glspl*{occ} and \glspl*{mba}; this is primarily due to how these objects move across the sky.
  The inner Solar System populations generally move faster, therefore an \glspl*{mba} is more likely to pass through sections of sky without templates and not get enough detections to be discovered.
  In comparison, a slower moving \gls*{tno} in the outer solar system covers less sky during discovery; its detection requires a smaller area of sky having templates and is therefore more likely.
  For each population, as $\Delta t$ increases there are only modest decreases of a few percent in discovery, which is small compared to the overall effect of template generation.
  
We performed an additional analysis assessing how differences in the survey cadence covering the ecliptic plane, where most \glspl*{sso} are located, affects discovery.
We split the \baseline survey into visits with Dec $\geq 0^{\circ}$, where the \gls*{nes} mini-survey is located, and Dec $< 0^{\circ}$, where the southern part of the ecliptic is primarily sampled by the \gls*{wfd} cadence.
  Following the previous methodology, these sets of visits were analysed separately by the \maf \gls*{sso} discovery metrics, the results of which are shown in Figure \ref{fig:temp_gen_discovery_metrics_dec}.
For visits with Dec $<0^{\circ}$ there is an increase in the fraction of \glspl*{sso} discovered during template generation compared to the previous analysis of the whole sky.
Accordingly the drop in discoveries is far greater for the Dec $\geq 0^{\circ}$ visits.
This implies that it is losses in the \gls*{nes} region that is dominating the overall reduction in \gls*{sso} discoveries during Year 1, whereas the areas of the ecliptic sampled by the \gls*{wfd} may not be as severely affected.
This is because the smaller number of visits in the \gls*{nes} compared to the \gls*{wfd} means that losing $\geq4$ visits to templates is a greater proportional loss, causing a larger fraction of missed \gls*{sso} detections.
		
		% In addition to discovery, we assessed the effects of template generation on the characterisation of \glspl*{sso}.
  % In Figure \ref{fig:temp_gen_colour_metrics} we present the results for the characterisation metric describing the fraction of \glspl*{sso} in the sample for which at least 4 colors are obtained from the $grizy$ filters.
  		In addition to discovery, we assessed the effects of template generation on the characterisation of \glspl*{sso}, namely the metric describing the fraction of \glspl*{sso} in the sample for which at least 4 colors are obtained from the $grizy$ filters.
		We follow the analysis of \cite{schwambTuningLegacySurvey2023} and only consider colors for the \glspl*{mba}, \gls*{neo} and \gls*{pha} populations.
		% \textbf{TNOs and OCCs do not get any colors when templates are considered.}
When considering only observations made in Year 1, the colour metric values for the nominal \baseline survey sit at only $\sim10\%$ for \glspl*{mba} and $\sim4\%$ for the \glspl*{neo} and \glspl*{pha}.
  % The colour characterisation metric drops dramatically when template generation is required.
  The colour characterisation metric drops dramatically when template generation is required, to values of $<1\%$.
This is not surprising given that this metric requires a larger number of detections (across multiple filters) compared to the minimum of 6 detections (in any filter) for discovery.
  Colours are useful for approximating the composition of an \gls*{sso}, but this result implies that during Year 1 we will only be able to measure colours for a small fraction of objects.
  However, as long as the objects are discovered and alerts are issued by \gls*{lsst} then the loss of colour information can be minimised by follow-up observations of the most interesting \glspl*{sso} using other facilities.
  We note that, of course, the problem of template generation still stands when considering that rapid \gls*{sso} alerts are required to enable timely follow-up observations in Year 1. 
		
		In Figure \ref{fig:completeness_over_time}, we consider in more detail how the cumulative completeness (that is the fraction of objects in the sample that have been discovered) increases as a function of survey time.
  Compared to the baseline, discoveries for all populations (and all $\Delta t$) are delayed by approximately 70 days.
  In other words, our simulation of template generation implies that there will be no \gls*{sso} discoveries in the first couple months of the survey.
  This delay arises primarily from the $\sim 50$ day timescale required to build up sufficient visits for a given patch of sky (Figure \ref{fig:cum_baseline_filter}), plus the additional time to acquire the detections for \gls*{sso} discovery (3 nightly pairs over a $\sim 2$ week period).
  Because of this temporal offset relative to the baseline survey the total number of discoveries at the end of Year 1 is reduced across all test populations, similar to the results in Figure \ref{fig:temp_gen_discovery_metrics}.
  
Accounting for this delay, the cumulative discovery curves approximately track the baseline, however there are times when discoveries plateau in our simulations.
This is because our analysis depends strongly on the survey start date and when the ecliptic, where a significant number of \gls*{sso} are located, is visible. 
Based on previous versions of the Rubin Project timeline, the start date for \baseline was assumed to be May 2025.
From the observing site the \gls*{nes} is observable by the survey for the first time in the period September - February 2025. 
Further delays to the survey start date could reduce the amount of time available to observe the \gls*{nes} and have an even more dramatic effect on \gls*{sso} discoveries.
This is explored further in an extension of this study focused on mitigating the impact of Year 1 template generation on \gls*{sso} science (Schwamb et al., in prep.).
Future investigations should account for any changes to the survey schedule as the timeline becomes more clear.
		
		The results of these \maf solar system metrics provide a more direct estimate of the effects of template generation on solar system science than simply looking at the sky area with templates considered in Section \ref{sec:template_coverage}.
		We can clearly see that the requirements of template generation leads to large drops in the discovery and measurement of colors for the dynamical populations investigated.
		If we consider the analysis in \cite{schwambTuningLegacySurvey2023}, they compared different survey strategies and stated that a $\pm5\%$ variation in a given metric (relative to the baseline survey at the time) would be acceptable for solar system science cases.
		However these results show drops of $28-63\%$ in discovery relative to the baseline across all test populations (Figure \ref{fig:temp_gen_discovery_metrics}), alongside delays of $\gtrsim 60$ days before \gls*{sso} discoveries can be made (Figure \ref{fig:completeness_over_time}).
		Altogether these results highlight that number and rate of ``real-time'' solar system discoveries in Year 1 will be severely affected by template generation.

		\section{Summary and Conclusions}
		\label{sec:summary_conclusions}
		
		We have investigated the impact of incremental template generation in Year 1 of \gls*{lsst} using the \rubinsim simulated \baseline observing strategy and associated \gls*{lsst} \maf metrics. %, assuming that the Rubin scheduler executes the baseline strategy. 
  Focusing on solar system discovery and characterization metrics, we used \maf to simulate the effects of generating templates in the first year of the survey.
  This was done by dividing Year 1 into a series of template generation nights and counting the number of visits in each healpixel of the sky and establishing when the criteria for template generation was met.
  We utilised only observations from the main survey (i.e.\ excluding \gls*{ddf} and twilight visits), assuming that there was no significant contribution of template-grade observations made during the commissioning of Rubin Observatory, and excluding the \glspl*{ddf} and low-solar elongation twilight survey observations. 
  Having used a $\Delta t = $ 3, 7, 14, and 28 day template building cadence coupled with the requirement of $\geq90\%$ template coverage for each \gls*{lsst} observation, we summarize our findings below:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Early template generation is preferred. The sooner templates are generated, the closer the performance will be to the idealized \baseline observing strategy's real-time discovery rates. This is because more observations become available for nightly prompt processing at shorter template production timescales. 
   			 % 5 We expect it will take approximately 2 months from the start of the survey to build sufficient numbers of templates in multiple filters for nightly solar system discoveries by \gls*{ssp} to begin. 
       We expect it will take $\sim 50$ days from the start of the survey to build significant template coverage across the sky, followed by $\sim 2$ weeks before  \gls*{sso} discoveries are made by the \gls*{ssp} pipeline.
       This results in a total delay of over 2 months before significant numbers of nightly \gls*{sso} alerts will be issued.
			 Across all the metrics we evaluated, a monthly template strategy performs the worst. A 3 day/7 day turnaround time for template production provides the most opportunities to identify transient sources in \gls*{lsst} observations in real-time and results in more uniform coverage across the sky. 
   

			\item Both solar system discoverability and color metrics are significantly affected by template generation, with the shorter template generation timescales performing slightly better. 
			 The discovery metrics across all dynamical populations tested here have a $\gtrsim28\%$ decrease compared to the nominal Year 1 baseline metrics. The \gls*{mba} discovery metrics are impacted the most with a drop $>40\%$ for the larger ($H \leq$ 16) objects and $>60\%$ for the smaller asteroids ($H \leq$ 21). 
			% \item 9 In general, the discoverability of smaller (and typically fainter) objects are impacted more significantly by Year 1 template generation than larger (typically brighter) objects. 
			 The inner solar system color metrics are impacted more severely than the discovery metrics. There is a drop of more than $90\%$ compared to the nominal Year 1 baseline for the \gls*{mba}, \gls*{neo}, and \gls*{pha} populations. 

			\item For all incremental template timescales, coverage in $g$-band and $u$-band visits lags significantly behind the other filters due to the small number of scheduled observations in these filters during Year 1. 
			 Likewise, due to the reduced number of visits planned in the \gls*{nes} (compared to the \gls*{wfd}), a significant number of Year 1 \gls*{nes} visits will not have templates and will not be processed by the nightly \gls*{rpp} pipelines for identification of transient sources and moving \glspl*{sso}.
    % \gls*{nes} visits in the $g$-band are particularly affected.
                   The overall loss of \gls*{sso} discoveries in Year 1 is dominated by the lack of templates in the \gls*{nes}. The discovery metrics within the \gls*{nes} are half the value computed for \gls*{wfd} fields. 

                		\end{itemize}

		Without modifications to the baseline (\baseline) Year 1 observing strategy, there will still be some \gls*{lsst} observations with suitable templates made as the survey progresses to allow image subtraction and alert generation within 60\ s of image readout, enabling the \gls*{rpp} and \gls*{ssp} pipelines to run and generate nightly solar system discoveries/alerts.
  But there is a non-negligible hit to real-time detection and characterization of solar system small bodies. 
  The change in \maf metrics is much higher than the 5$\%$ difference from the baseline strategy deemed acceptable in the evaluation of cadence parameters for optimizing \gls*{lsst} solar system System science by \cite{schwambTuningLegacySurvey2023}. 
  For each simulated small body population investigated here, the larger objects are impacted less because they are typically brighter in apparent magnitude and thus more likely to be detectable in most or all of the \gls*{lsst} observations that they are present in. 
  Smaller (and typically fainter) objects require more chances to be able to detect them, and thus are impacted more severely by incremental template generation strategies. 
	The drop in the discovery metrics is likely influenced by the lack of $g$-band templates, as $g$ is typically paired with the $r$ filter in nightly pairs. 
  Furthermore, the lack of templates in the \gls*{nes} region leads to a significant loss of \gls*{sso} discoveries.
		Exploring options for boosting Year 1 template production in low-coverage filters and sky regions (i.e.\ the $g$ filter and \gls*{nes}) are likely first steps to improving the number of nightly pairs searchable each night for moving objects. 
  % describe override g tests here?
		
		In this work we have focused on the impact on solar system metrics, but there are parallels that can be drawn to the discovery of other astrophysical transients using the Rubin alert stream. 
  An \gls*{lsst} visit will only be able to produce alerts when the visit's on-sky footprint has adequate template coverage, which requires a sufficient number of previous observations (in the same filter).
  In this study we have demonstrated that template generation reduces the area of survey sky able to generate alerts, %leading to a non-negligible impact on the solar system discovery metrics, which requires 3 nightly pairs of observations within $\sim14$ days. 
  focusing on the impact on \gls*{sso} science.
  However our results imply there will be reductions in real-time astrophysical transient alerts across the science cases in Year 1.
  For example, it will take several observations to identify the characteristic brightening in a transient light-curve consistent with a supernovae or tidal disruption event. 
  Additionally, the variable stars and astrophysical transients community has advocated for different filters to be used in \gls*{lsst} nightly pairs \citep{2019PASPpresto}, with $g$ and $u$-bands paired with $r$ to explore color evolution over a night \citep{SCOC_Report_1, SCOC_Report_2}. 
  We have demonstrated that the template coverage of bluer $ug$ filters lags behind the redder filters.
  This will impact the availability of pairs of detections, therefore reducing chances to discover and characterize fast-changing explosive transients. 
  Further work is needed to explore the full impact of incremental template generation on discovery and rapid follow-up of transients in the various \gls*{lsst} science goals during Year 1 of the survey. 
		
		This work is a first step towards understanding the expected discovery yields and discovery output from the \gls*{rpp} data products and Rubin alert stream in Year 1 operations. 
		The Rubin Observatory operations and data management teams have yet to settle on an incremental template strategy \citep{DMTN-107,RTN-011}. 
		Based on our analysis, we strongly recommend that they explore the possibility of generating templates on weekly or shorter timescales.  
		We have assumed that there is no significant contribution to Year 1 templates from commissioning data and that the \baseline observing strategy is executed with no modifications to prioritize incremental template building during Year 1. 
  We have also assumed that the first four suitable observations of a given patch are used to produce templates with generous image quality constraints. 
  Compared to later templates made from more images, these Year 1 incremental templates may have more artifacts and/or lower \gls*{snr} which could impact the detection of faint sources or the identification of extended sources (which are an indicator of cometary activity for example) against the background noise.
		Further analysis is needed to explore more sophisticated strategies and differing requirements for incremental template generation. 
        
The \gls*{lsst} observing cadence has been carefully optimized to maximise results for all main science goals across the 10 year survey, however, it is not necessarily optimized for incremental template generation in Year 1.
  This is because the alerts ``lost'' due to template generation in Year 1 will be retrieved when all data is reprocessed at the first Data Release; but we lose the ``real-time'' nature of the transient alerts and the opportunities for follow-up in Year 1.
		Further \rubinsim simulations are needed to examine if, and how, the Rubin scheduler can be tuned to maximize template production over the Year 1 without significantly impacting the 10-year outputs of the survey. 
		% Strategies to boost the $g$ and $u$ template production rates in Year 1 should also be considered.
  It is important for the community and the \gls*{scoc} to explore possible modifications to the Year 1 observing cadence  that may significantly boost template production, such as earmarking a small amount of Year 1 observing time for template building. 
		% Currently the \gls*{lsst} survey strategy employs two back-to-back 15 s exposures (snaps) per visit that are combined to produce a single \gls*{lsst} observation.
  % The \gls*{scoc} and Rubin Observatory are considering moving to one 30 s snap per visit which would reduce overheads due to image readout. 
 % Some of this additional observing time could go into template building observations in low coverage sky areas or filters that are more adversely affected by template generation, such as the \gls*{gp}/\gls*{nes} and the $ug$ filters respectively.

% If it is not possible for \gls*{lsst} to switch to 1 snap per visit or allocate the freed up on-sky time,
Other alternatives to boost the number of observations in the \gls*{nes} in Year 1 should be explored. 
Closely following from this work, Schwamb et al. (in prep.) investigates possible strategies for optimizing Year 1 \gls*{sso} science given the requirements of building templates.

It is vital that studies exploring the possible parameter space for incremental template generation within the \gls*{lsst} observing strategy and its impact on the \gls*{lsst} 10-year and Year 1 \maf metrics be completed before the start of Rubin on-sky commissioning with \gls*{lsstcam} (currently expected to start in early 2025). 
This will provide an opportunity to optimize the Year 1 observing strategy for alert production while giving the community time to initiate follow-up preparations for the start of \gls*{lsst} with the best picture of what Year 1 nightly outputs of the survey will look like.
