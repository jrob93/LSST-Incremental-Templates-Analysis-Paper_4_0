  abstract = {We describe the simulated sky survey underlying the second data challenge (DC2) carried out in preparation for analysis of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC). Significant connections across multiple science domains will be a hallmark of LSST; the DC2 program represents a unique modeling effort that stresses this interconnectivity in a way that has not been attempted before. This effort encompasses a full end-to-end approach: starting from a large N-body simulation, through setting up LSST-like observations including realistic cadences, through image simulations, and finally processing with Rubin's LSST Science Pipelines. This last step ensures that we generate data products resembling those to be delivered by the Rubin Observatory as closely as is currently possible. The simulated DC2 sky survey covers six optical bands in a wide-fast-deep area of approximately 300 deg2, as well as a deep drilling field of approximately 1 deg2. We simulate 5 yr of the planned 10 yr survey. The DC2 sky survey has multiple purposes. First, the LSST DESC working groups can use the data set to develop a range of DESC analysis pipelines to prepare for the advent of actual data. Second, it serves as a realistic test bed for the image processing software under development for LSST by the Rubin Observatory. In particular, simulated data provide a controlled way to investigate certain image-level systematic effects. Finally, the DC2 sky survey enables the exploration of new scientific ideas in both static and time domain cosmology.},

  abstract = {Previous efforts have modeled the Didymos system as two irregularly shaped rigid bodies, although it is likely that one or both components are in fact rubble piles. Here, we relax the rigid-body assumption to quantify how this affects the spin and orbital dynamics of the system following the DART impact. Given known fundamental differences between our simulation codes, we find that faster rigid-body simulations produce nearly the same result as rubble-pile models in scenarios with a moderate value for the momentum enhancement factor, \$\textbackslash beta\$ (\$\textbackslash beta\{\textbackslash sim\}3\$) and an ellipsoidal secondary. This indicates that the rigid-body approach is likely adequate for propagating the post-impact dynamics necessary to meet DART Mission requirements. Although, if Dimorphos has a highly-irregular shape or structure, or if \$\textbackslash beta\$ is unexpectedly large, then rubble-pile effects may become important. If Dimorphos's orbit and spin state are sufficiently excited, then surface particle motion is also possible. However, these simulations are limited in their resolution and range of material parameters, so they serve as a demonstration of principle, and Future work is required to fully understand the likelihood and magnitude of surface motion.},

  abstract = {NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission will kinetically impact Dimorphos, the secondary component of the Didymos binary asteroid system, which will excite Dimorphos's dynamical state and lead to significant libration about the synchronous state and possibly chaotic non-principal axis rotation. Although this particular outcome is human caused, many other secondary components of binary systems are also prone to such exotic spin states. For a satellite in an excited spin state, the time-varying tidal and rotational environment can lead to significant surface accelerations. Depending on the circumstances, this mechanism may drive granular motion on the surface of the secondary. We modeled the dynamical evolution of a Didymos-like binary asteroid system using a fully coupled, three-dimensional simulation code. Then, we computed the time-varying gravitational and rotational accelerations felt over the entire surface resulting from the secondary's perturbed dynamical state. We find that an excited spin and orbit can induce large changes in the effective surface slope, potentially triggering granular motion and surface refreshment. However, for the case of the DART impact, this effect is highly dependent on many unknowns, such as Dimorphos's detailed shape, bulk density, surface geology, and the momentum transferred. Aside from the Didymos system and the DART mission, this effect also has important implications for binary systems in general.},

  abstract = {We present the results of narrowband photometry of 85 comets observed over a period of 17 years. The data have been reduced homogeneously to molecular production rates and a proxy for the dust production rate. We confirm previous investigations, both our own and those of others, showing that there is no differentiation with depth in the cometary nucleus, that most comets are very similar to each other in chemical composition, and that the dust-to-gas ratio does not vary with the dynamical age of the comet. There is little variation of relative abundances with heliocentric distance, implying that for the species we observe the role of density-dependent processes in the coma is small. There is also little variation from one apparition to the next for most short-period comets. We show, however, that there are significant compositional groupings of comets, apparently related to place of formation. Specifically, the majority of comets originating in the Kuiper belt appear to be significantly depleted in the carbon-chain molecules that lead to the observed C2 and C3. Kuiper belt comets also exhibit smaller active areas, steeper slopes, and greater asymmetries about perihelion than do other comets, implying smaller active fractions. We argue that at least the compositional effect is primordial rather than evolutionary. We also show a significant but unexplained correlation of some properties, notably the dust-to-gas ratio, with perihelion distance. We provide strong evidence that most CN, some C2, and virtually no NH are produced from grains in the coma rather than from nuclear ices. Evidence suggests that the mixing between water and other ices occurs at the level of grains rather than at the molecular level. We also show that there must be a large population of comets having very low activity. The data appear to require mixing of cometesimals with different compositions into individual nuclei, with some nuclei containing nearly the full range of compositions seen in the ensemble while others contain a much smaller range of compositions.},

In the last several years Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) provided evidence of grain growth, gas-dust decoupling, and sub-structures such as rings and gaps in the dust continuum. Molecular line observations revealed radial and vertical distributions of molecular abundances and also provided significant constraints on the gas dynamics such as turbulence. While sub-millimeter and millimeter observations mainly probe the gas and dust outside the radius of several au, ice and inner warm gas are investigated at shorter wavelengths. Gas and dust dynamics are key to connecting these observational findings. One of the emerging trends is inhomogeneous distributions of elemental abundances, most probably due to dust-gas decoupling.},

As a proof of concept, we introduce "Maneage" (Managing data lineage), enabling cheap archiving, provenance extraction, and peer verification that has been tested in several research publications. We show that longevity is a realistic requirement that does not sacrifice immediate or short-term reproducibility.

"Noise-based" and "non-parametric" imply that this technique imposes negligible constraints on the properties of the targets and that it employs no regression analysis or fittings. The sub-sky detection threshold is defined and initial detections are found, independently of the sky value. False detections are then estimated and removed using the ambient noise as a reference. This results in a purity level of 0.89 for the final detections as compared to 0.29 for SExtractor when a completeness of 1 is desired for a sample of extremely faint and diffuse mock galaxy profiles. The difference in the mean of the undetected pixels with the known background of mock images is decreased by 4.6 times depending on the diffuseness of the test profiles, quantifying the success in their detection. A non-parametric approach to defining substructure over a detected region is also introduced. NoiseChisel is our software implementation of this new technique. Contrary to the existing signal-based approach to detection, in its various implementations, signal-related parameters such as the image point spread function or known object shapes and models are irrelevant here. Such features make this technique very useful in astrophysical applications such as detection, photometry, or morphological analysis of nebulous objects buried in noise, for example, galaxies that do not generically have a known shape when imaged.},

This coorbital motion will last at least thousands of years but ends {$\sim$}10 kyr from now; 2013 VZ70 is thus another example of the already-known ``transient coorbital'' populations of the giant planets, with this being the first known prograde example for Saturn (temporary retrograde coorbitals are known for Jupiter and Saturn). We present a theoretical steady-state model of the scattering population of trans-Neptunian origin in the giant planet region (2\textendash 34 au), including the temporary coorbital populations of the four giant planets. We expose this model to observational biases using survey simulations in order to compare the model to the real detections made by a set of well-characterized outer solar system surveys. While the observed number of coorbitals relative to the scattering population is higher than predicted, we show that the number of observed transient coorbitals of each giant planet relative to each other is consistent with a transNeptunian source.},

These pose a long-standing conundrum for solar system formation models as they can only be created in the inner hot disk at temperatures higher than 800 K, and there is no obvious mechanism to transport them out into the comets formation region. Here we propose that these particles could have formed inside the hydrostatic envelopes surrounding young protoplanets still embedded in the protoplanetary disk. Using a simplified 1D model we investigate the thermal structure of these envelopes, and find that for core masses ranging from 0.08 to 1.5 M\_Earth, located anywhere between 1 and 30 AU, the temperature and pressure at the base of the envelopes are high enough to quickly vaporize silicate particles of various sizes. Moreover, if the grain abundance is at least solar, these envelopes become fully convective, allowing for dust ejection across the Bondi radius back into the disk. Amorphous silicates are hence thermally processed into crystalline particles in these envelopes, and then transported back to disk through convective diffusion to be finally incorporated into the cometary building blocks.},

We present here a well defined and reasonably homogeneous photometric database for 25 of the brightest Galactic globular clusters located in the direction of the inner Galaxy. These data were obtained in the B, V, and I bands using the Magellan 6.5 m Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope. A new technique is extensively used in this paper to map the differential reddening in the individual cluster fields, and to produce cleaner, dereddened color\textendash magnitude diagrams for all the clusters in the database. Subsequent papers will detail the astrophysical analysis of the cluster populations, and the properties of the obscuring material along the clusters' lines of sight.},

  abstract = {Context: We use phase curves of small bodies to measure absolute magnitudes and, together with complementary theoretical and laboratory results, to understand their surfaces' micro and macroscopic properties. Although we can observe asteroids up to phase angles of about 30 deg, the range of phase angles covered by outer solar system objects usually does not go further than 7 to 10 deg for centaurs and 2 deg for trans-Neptunian objects, and a linear relation between magnitude and phase angle may be assumed. Aims: We aim at directly comparing data taken for objects in the inner solar system (inside the orbit of Jupiter) with data of centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects. Methods: We use the SLOAN Moving Objects Catalog data to construct phase curves restricted to phase angles less than or equal to 7.5 deg, compatible with the angles observed for the trans-Neptunian/Centaur population. We assume a linear model for the photometric behavior to obtain absolute magnitudes and phase coefficients in the ugirz, V, and R filters. Results: We obtained absolute magnitudes in seven filters for \${$>$}4000\$ objects. Our comparison with outer solar system objects points to a common property of the surfaces: intrinsically redder objects become blue with increasing phase angle, while the opposite happens for intrinsically bluer objects.},

The method we developed is fully automatic and well suited for a run based on large amounts of data. Moreover, it includes the nominal uncertainties in the magnitudes and the whole distribution of possible rotational states of the objects producing what are possibly less precise values, that is, larger uncertainties, but more accurate, namely, closer to the actual value.

Here we use N-body simulations of the formation of the Kuiper belt and Oort cloud as well as a survey simulator to compare models of the solar system with and without a 9th planet to one another as well as to observations. The main mechanism for TNOs to be deposited into the distant (a{$>$}50 au), detached (q {$>$}40 au) region of the Kuiper Belt in the 8-planet model is Kozai-Lidov oscillation of objects in mean motion resonances (MMR) with Neptune. This effect does not deposit low-inclination (i 20{$\smwhtcircle$}) objects into this region. However, we find that the 9th planet generates a group of distant, detached TNOs at low inclinations that are not present in the 8-planet model. This disparity between the 8-planet and the 9-planet models could provide a strong constraint on a possible planet 9 with further detections of TNOs in the distant, detached region of the Kuiper Belt.},

  abstract = {Comet C/2016 R2 PanSTARRS (hereafter C/2016 R2) presents an unusually high N2/CO abundance ratio, as well as a heavy depletion in H2O, making it the only known comet of its kind. Understanding its dynamical history is therefore of essential importance as it would allow us to gain a clearer understanding of the evolution of planetesimal formation in our Solar System. Two studies have independently estimated the possible origin of this comet from building blocks formed in a peculiar region of the protoplanetary disk, near the ice line of CO and N2. We intend to investigate the fates of objects formed from the building blocks in these regions. We hope to find a possible explanation for the lack of C/2016 R2-like comets in our Solar System. Using a numerical simulation of the early stages of Solar System formation, we track the dynamics of these objects in the Jumping Neptune scenario based on five different initial conditions for the protosolar disk. We integrate the positions of 250 000 planetesimals over time in order to analyze the evolution of their orbits and create a statistical profile of their expected permanent orbit. Results. We find that objects formed in the region of the CO- and N2- ice lines are highly likely to be sent towards the Oort Cloud or possibly ejected from the Solar System altogether on a relatively short timescale. In all our simulations, over 90\% of clones formed in this region evolved into a hyperbolic trajectory, and between 1\% and 10\% were potentially captured by the Oort Cloud. The handful of comets that remained were either on long-period, highly eccentric orbits like C/2016 R2, or absorbed into the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt. Comets formed {$<$}15 au were predominantly ejected early in the formation timeline. As this is the formation zone likely to produce comets of this composition, this process could explain the lack of similar comets observed in the Solar System},

In this context, `pebbles' represent mm- to cm-sized dust aggregates composed of (sub)micron-sized dust particles, and the structure of km-sized comets is thought to be an agglomerate of pebbles. The contact radius for pebble\textendash pebble contacts was modelled in an earlier study; however, the pressure dependence of the interpebble contact radius was not considered. Here, we revisit the interpebble contact radius in a comet nucleus. We calculated the interpebble contact radius based on JKR contact theory, and we took into consideration the effect of lithostatic pressure. We found that the interpebble contact radius varies with depth from the surface, and the earlier model underestimated it by one order of magnitude at the centre of the comet nucleus.},

In this study, we perform numerical simulations using soft-sphere discrete element methods and demonstrate that the sticking probability decreases with increasing aggregate radius. Our results suggest that the large discrepancy in the threshold filling factor may reflect the difference in the size of dust aggregates in earlier numerical simulations and laboratory experiments.},

These are (42355) Typhon-Echidna and (65489) Ceto-Phorcys. In this work, we focused our analyses on the temporal evolution of the TyphonEchidna binary system through the outer and inner planetary systems. Using numerical integrations of the N-body gravitational problem, we explored the orbital evolutions of 500 clones of Typhon, recording the close encounters of those clones with planets. We then analysed the effects of those encounters on the binary system. It was found that only {$\approx$}22 per cent of the encounters with the giant planets were strong enough to disrupt the binary. This binary system has an {$\approx$}3.6 per cent probability of reaching the terrestrial planetary region over a time-scale of approximately 5.4 Myr. Close encounters of Typhon-Echidna with Earth and Venus were also registered, but the probabilities of such events occurring are low ({$\approx$}0.4 per cent). The orbital evolution of the system in the past was also investigated. It was found that in the last 100 Myr, Typhon might have spent most of its time as a TNB crossing the orbit of Neptune. Therefore, our study of the Typhon-Echidna orbital evolution illustrates the possibility of large cometary bodies (radii of 76 km for Typhon and 42 km for Echidna) coming from a remote region of the outer Solar system and that might enter the terrestrial planetary region preserving its binarity throughout the journey.},

From the spectroscopic study, strong emissions from \$CN (\textbackslash Delta \textbackslash nu = 0)\$, \$C\_3 (\textbackslash lambda 4050\$ \textbackslash AA), \$C\_2 (\textbackslash Delta \textbackslash nu = +1)\$ and \$C\_2 (\textbackslash Delta \textbackslash nu = 0)\$ can be observed during both the epochs of our observations. The Q(\$C\_2\$)/Q(CN) ratio classifies the comet as a typical comet. The imaging data reveals the presence of jets. The dust emission from the comet is observed to have a non-steady state outflow due to the presence of these strong jets which subside in later epochs, resulting in a steady state outflow. Polarimetric study at two different phase angles reveals the degree of polarization to be comparable to Jupiter family comets at similar phase angles. Localized variations in polarization values are observed in the coma. The dust modelling studies suggest the presence of high amount of silicate/low absorbing material and indicate the coma to be dominated by higher amount of large size grains with low porosity having power law size distribution index = 2.4.

The kinetic energy of the impactor was equivalent to approximately two megatons of TNT, an order of magnitude greater than that of previously detected flashes on Jupiter and comparable with the Tunguska impact on Earth in 1908. This detection indicates that Tunguska-like impact events on Jupiter occur approximately once per year, two to three orders of magnitude more frequently than terrestrial impacts. The observed flash displayed a single-temperature blackbody spectrum with an effective temperature of approximately 8300 K without clear temporal variation, possibly representing common radiative features of terrestrial Tunguskaclass superbolides.},

The relative importance of these processes depends upon the initial mass, size, and magnetization of the disk, and subsequently on its opacity, ionization state, and external irradiation. Disk dynamics is therefore coupled to star formation, pre-main-sequence stellar evolution, and dust coagulation during the early stages of planet formation and may vary dramatically from star to star.

  abstract = {This review, based on lectures given at the 45th Saas-Fee Advanced Course ``From Protoplanetary Disks to Planet Formation'', introduces physical processes in protoplanetary disks relevant to accretion and the initial stages of planet formation. After reprising the elementary theory of disk structure and evolution, I discuss the gas-phase physics of angular momentum transport through turbulence and disk winds, and how this may be related to episodic accretion observed in Young Stellar Objects. Turning to solids, I review the evolution of single particles under aerodynamic forces, and describe the conditions necessary for the development of collective gas-particle instabilities. Observations show that disks are not always radially smooth axisymmetric structures, and I discuss how gas and particle processes can interact to form observable large-scale structure (at ice lines, vortices and in zonal flows). I conclude with disk dispersal.},

  abstract = {Families of asteroids generated by the collisional fragmentation of a common parent body have been identified using clustering methods of asteroids in their proper orbital element space. An alternative method has been developed in order to identify collisional families from the correlation between the asteroid fragment sizes and their proper semi-major axis distance from the family centre (V-shape). This method has been shown to be effective in the cases of the very diffuse families that formed billions of years ago. We obtained photometric observations of asteroids in order to construct their rotational light curves; we combine them with the literature light curves and sparse-in-time photometry; we input these data in the light curve inversion methods to determine the shape and the spin pole of the asteroids in order to assess whether an object is prograde or retrograde. The ultimate goal is to assess whether we find an excess of retrograde asteroids on the inward side of the V-shape of a 4 Gyr asteroid family identified via the V-shape method. This excess of retrograde rotators is predicted by the theory of asteroid family evolution. We obtained the spin poles for 55 asteroids claimed to belong to a 4 Gyr collisional family of the inner main belt that consists of low-albedo asteroids. After re-evaluating the albedo and spectroscopic information, we found that nine of these asteroids are interlopers in the 4 Gyr family. Of the 46 remaining asteroids, 31 are found to be retrograde and 15 prograde. We also found that these retrograde rotators have a very low probability (1.29\%) of being due to random sampling from an underlying uniform distribution of spin poles. Our results constitute corroborating evidence that the asteroids identified as members of a 4 Gyr collisional family have a common origin, thus strengthening their family membership.},

The two main processes that lead to regolith production are the micrometeorite bombardment and the thermal cracking. Here we report the production of a weak simulant material, analogue to carbonaceous meteorites with a CM-like composition, following the preliminary compositional results for Bennu and Ryugu. This asteroid simulant has compressive and flexural strength 1.8 {$\pm$} 0.17 and 0.7 {$\pm$} 0.07 MPa, respectively. The thermal conductivity (in air) of the simulant at room temperature is between 0.43 and 0.47 W m-1 K-1. In order to distinguish the type of regolith that is produced by each of these processes, we present and discuss the results of the experimental campaign focused on laboratory hypervelocity impacts, using the 2-stage lightgas gun of the University of Kent, that mimic the micrometeorite bombardment. We find that this process produces both monomineralic and multimineralic fragments, resulting in a difficulty to distinguish the two processes, at least on these weak materials.},

  abstract = {The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will survey the southern sky from 2022\textendash 2032 with unprecedented detail. Since the observing strategy can lead to artifacts in the data, we investigate the effects of telescope-pointing offsets (called dithers) on the r-band coadded 5{$\sigma$} depth yielded after the 10-year survey. We analyze this survey depth for several geometric patterns of dithers (e.g., random, hexagonal lattice, spiral) with amplitudes as large as the radius of the LSST field of view, implemented on different timescales (per season, per night, per visit). Our results illustrate that per night and per visit dither assignments are more effective than per season assignments. Also, we find that some dither geometries (e.g., hexagonal lattice) are particularly sensitive to the timescale on which the dithers are implemented, while others like random dithers perform well on all timescales. We then model the propagation of depth variations to artificial fluctuations in galaxy counts, which are a systematic for LSS studies. We calculate the bias in galaxy counts caused by the observing strategy accounting for photometric calibration uncertainties, dust extinction, and magnitude cuts; uncertainties in this bias limit our ability to account for structure induced by the observing strategy. We find that after 10 years of the LSST survey, the best dither strategies lead to uncertainties in this bias that are smaller than the minimum statistical floor for a galaxy catalog as deep as r{$<$}27.5. A few of these strategies bring the uncertainties close to the statistical floor for r{$<$}25.7 after the first year of survey.},

The ultimate goal was to obtain constraints on the characteristics of the ejected dust for modeling purposes. Before impact, Didymos exhibited a linear polarization rapidly increasing with phase angle, reaching a level of {$\sim$}5\% in the blue and {$\sim$}4.5\% in the red. The shape of the polarization spectrum was anticorrelated with that of its reflectance spectrum, which appeared typical of an S-class asteroid. After impact, the level of polarization dropped by about 1 percentage point (pp) in the blue band and about 0.5 pp in the red band, then continued to linearly increase with phase angle, with a slope similar to that measured prior to impact. The polarization spectra, once normalized by their values at an arbitrary wavelength, show very little or no change over the course of all observations before and after impact. The lack of any remarkable change in the shape of the polarization spectrum after impact suggests that the way in which polarization varies with wavelength depends on the composition of the scattering material, rather than on its structure, be this a surface or a debris cloud.},

We determined a rotational pole direction of R.A./decl.= 81\textdegree/+29\textdegree{} with an obliquity of 97\textdegree{} and a sidereal rotation period of 41.45{$\pm$}0.05 hr.

Water morphology based on OH was quite different from that of the carbon-bearing species, implying a different driver for the polar jets such as CO or CO2.

Our program began in 1976, and to date includes observations of nearly 220 comets. Of these, over 190 have measured OH fluxes, which are converted to production rates for OH and are then readily converted to H2O production rates. We use these water production values for several investigations, including deriving each comet's extrapolated water production rate at perihelion, calculating the surface area required to produce the observed water production for each comet (i.e. the effective active area), and finding the fractional active area for over 50 of these objects with published nucleus sizes. Our large sample allows us to not only look at these properties within the ensemble of comets, but to also examine differences among these objects based on their dynamical ages. Clear trends emerge for each of these analyses based on the bulk division of Jupiter-family (JF) comets, presumed to mostly originate from the Kuiper belt, and non-JF comets, presumed to mostly originate from the Oort cloud. Within the non-JF comets, the dynamically younger objects overall have higher extrapolated water production rates at perihelion than do the dynamically older members. We also see a clear trend in their effective active areas, with the dynamically new comets having the largest values while the older, Halley-type comets have the smallest. Though few of the younger comets have measured nucleus sizes, this trend persists when looking at the active fractions. Taken together, this provides clear evidence for the evolution of the surfaces of these comets towards lower activity. In comparison, the JF comets have overall smaller water production rates at perihelion. They exhibit a wide range of active areas and active fractions, which we conclude is a result of the JF comets having a full range of relative ages, i.e. physical evolution of their surfaces, with objects continually being moved in from the Kuiper belt, and resulting in varying amounts of time that these comets have spent in the inner solar system.

CO, CH4, Ar, and N2 were found to be released in three or four distinct temperature ranges, each resulting from a different trapping mechanism: (a) 30\textendash 55\textdegree K, where the gas frozen on the water ice evaporates; (b) 135\textendash 155\textdegree K, where gas is squeezed out of the water ice during the transformation of amorphous ice to cubic ice; (c) 165\textendash 190\textdegree K, where gas and water are released simultaneously, probably by the evaporation of a clathrate hydrate, and, occasionally (d) 160\textendash 175\textdegree K, where deeply buried gas is released during the transformation of cubic ice to hexagonal ice. If the third range is indeed due to clathrate formation, CO was found to form this compound. CO2 did not form a clathrate under the experimental conditions. Excess hydrogen did not affect the occlusion of other gases. Hydrogen itself was trapped only at 16\textdegree K. Neon was not trapped at 25\textdegree K. With cubic ice, the only trapping mechanism is freezing of gas on the ice surface. No fractionation between the gas phase and the ice was observed with a mixture of CO and Ar. Massive ejection of ice grains was observed during the evaporation of the gas in three (a,c,d) out of the four ranges. The experimental results are used to explain several cometary phenomena, especially those occurring at large heliocentric distances, and are applied also to Titan's atmospheric composition and to the possible ejection of ice grains from Enceladus.},

The band area ratio is 1.13 +/- 0.05. These spectral band parameters plot at the tip of the S(IV) region of the Gaffey S-asteroid subtypes plot suggesting an affinity to ordinary chondrite meteorites. We calculated the chemistry of the olivine and pyroxene using the Band I center to be 20.1 +/- 2.3 mol\% fayalite and 18.2 +/- 1.5 mol\% ferrosilite, consistent with H chondrites. Principal component analysis of 1998 OR2's combined visible-NIR spectrum fall on the C/X-complex side of the alpha-line, near the end of the shock darkening trend, consistent with its weak absorption bands (band depth {$<$} 5\%). We use an aerial mixing model with lab measurements of the shock darkened H5 chondrite, Chergach, to constrain the amount of shock darkened material on the asteroid's surface at \textasciitilde 63\% dark lithology and \textasciitilde 37\% light lithology.},

  abstract = {The distant scattered disk is a vast population of trans-Neptunian minor bodies that orbit the sun on highly elongated, long-period orbits. The orbital stability of scattered disk objects is primarily controlled by a single parameter \textendash{} their perihelion distance. While the existence of a perihelion boundary that separates chaotic and regular motion of long-period orbits is well established through numerical experiments, its theoretical basis as well as its semi-major axis dependence remain poorly understood. In this work, we outline an analytical model for the dynamics of distant trans-Neptunian objects and show that the orbital architecture of the scattered disk is shaped by an infinite chain of exterior 2 : j resonances with Neptune. The widths of these resonances increase as the perihelion distance approaches Neptune's semi-major axis, and their overlap drives chaotic motion. Within the context of this theoretical picture, we derive an analytic criterion for instability of long-period orbits, and demonstrate that rapid dynamical chaos ensues when the perihelion drops below a critical value, given by qcrit = aN ln((242/5) (mN/M ) (a/aN)5/2) 1/2. This expression constitutes an analytic boundary between the ``detached'' and actively ``scattering'' sub-populations of distant trans-Neptunian minor bodies. Additionally, we find that within the stochastic layer, the Lyapunov time of scattered disk objects approaches the orbital period, and show that the semi-major axis diffusion coefficient is approximated by Da {$\sim$} (8/(5 {$\pi$})) (mN/M ) G M aN exp -(q/aN)2/2 . We confirm our results with direct N -body simulations and highlight the connections between scattered disk dynamics and the Chirikov Standard Map. Implications of our results for the long-term evolution of minor bodies in the distant solar system are discussed.},

The proportionally greater number of discoveries of comets by surveys have yielded in turn larger samples of comet populations and sub-populations for study, resulting in better defined evolutionary trends. While providing an array of remarkable discoveries, most of the survey data has been only cursorily investigated.

Over the course of the 8 months of the survey, our results indicate that the number of LPCs passing within 1.5 au are a factor of several higher than previous estimates, while JFCs are within the previous range of estimates of a few thousand down to sizes near 1.3 km in diameter. Finally, we also observe evidence for structure in the orbital distribution of LPCs, with an overdensity of comets clustered near 110\textdegree inclination and perihelion near 2.9 au that is not attributable to observational bias.},

  abstract = {Generally, the reflectance of a particulate surface depends on the phase angle at which it is observed. This is true for laboratory measurements on powders of natural materials as well as remote observations of Solar System surfaces. Here, we measured the dependences of reflectance spectra with phase angles, of a suite of 72 meteorites in the 400\textendash 2600 nm range. The 10\textendash 30{$\smwhtcircle$} phase angle range is investigated in order to study the contribution of Shadow Hiding Opposition Effect (SHOE) to the phase behavior. The behavior is then extrapolated to phase angle of 0{$\smwhtcircle$} using a polynomial fit, in order to provide grounds for comparison across meteorite groups (enabling to remove the contribution of shadows to reflectance) as well as to provide ``equivalent albedo'' values that should be comparable to geometric albedo values derived for small bodies. We find a general behavior of increasing strength of the SHOE with lower reflectance values (whether between samples or for a given samples with ab\- sorption features). This trend provides a first order way to correct any reflectance spectra of meteorite powders measured under standard conditions (g = 30{$\smwhtcircle$}) from the contribution of shadows. The g = 0{$\smwhtcircle$} calculated reflectance and equivalent albedos are then compared to typical values of albedos for main-belt asteroids. This reveals that among carbonaceous chondrites only Tagish Lake group, CI, and CM chondrites have equivalent albedo compatible with C- and D-type asteroids. On the other hand equivalent albedo derived with CO, CR and CK chondrites are compatible with L- and K-type asteroids. The equivalent albedo derived for ordinary chon\- drites is related to petrographic types, with low-grade petrographic type (type 3.6 and less) being generally darker that higher petrographic types. This works provides a framework for further understanding of the as\- teroids meteorite linkage in particular when combining with colors and spectroscopy.},

It is shown that surface albedo is the main factor influencing the amplitude and width of the asteroid opposition effect. The amplitude of opposition effect depends on asteroid albedo in a non-monotonic way with the maximum for moderate albedo asteroids decreasing both for dark and for high albedo asteroids. This can be explained by the combined influence of both shadow hiding and coherent-backscatter mechanisms. The relative contribution of the coherent-backscatter effect to the asteroid magnitude-phase dependence close to opposition ({$\alpha$}=0.3\textdegree ) is estimated to be about 20-60\% for low albedo asteroids and 80-90\% for high and moderate albedo asteroids. At {$\alpha>$}5\textdegree{} the shadow-hiding effect has the dominant influence. A tendency was found for asteroids with larger U-B colors to show larger values of the opposition effect. We also compare the opposition effects of asteroids with those of some atmosphereless satellites and meteorites.},

We analysed the polarimetric characteristics of M/X-type asteroids along with the available data obtained by other techniques. Results. New polarimetric observations of 22 M/X-type asteroids combined with published observations provide a data set of 41 asteroids for which the depth of a negative polarisation branch and/or inversion angle were determined. We found that the depth of the negative polarisation branch tends to increase with decreasing steepness of the near-infrared spectra. Asteroids with a deeper negative polarisation branch tend to have a higher radar circular polarisation ratio. We show that, based on the relationship of the depth of the negative polarisation branch and inversion angle, two main sub-types can be distinguished among M-type asteroids. We suggest that these groups may be related to different surface compositions similar to (1) irons and stony-irons and (2) enstatite and iron-rich carbonaceous chondrites.},

  abstract = {We report the results of video observations of tiny (diameter less than 100 m) near-Earth objects (NEOs) with Tomo-e Gozen on the Kiso 105 cm Schmidt telescope. A rotational period of a tiny asteroid reflects its dynamical history and physical properties since smaller objects are sensitive to the YORP effect. We carried out video observations of 60 tiny NEOs at 2 fps from 2018 to 2021 and successfully derived the rotational periods and axial ratios of 32 NEOs including 13 fast rotators with rotational periods less than 60 s. The fastest rotator found during our survey is 2020 HS7 with a rotational period of 2.99 s. We statistically confirmed that there is a certain number of tiny fast rotators in the NEO population, which have been missed with any previous surveys. We have discovered that the distribution of the tiny NEOs in a diameter and rotational period (D-P) diagram is truncated around a period of 10 s. The truncation with a flat-top shape is not explained well either by a realistic tensile strength of NEOs or suppression of YORP by meteoroid impacts. We propose that the dependence of the tangential YORP effect on the rotational period potentially explains the observed pattern in the D-P diagram.},

  abstract = {The observation of pits at the surface of comets offers the opportunity to take a glimpse into the properties and the mechanisms that shape a nucleus through cometary activity. If the origin of these pits is still a matter of debate, multiple studies have recently suggested that known phase transitions alone could not have carved these morphological features on the surface of 67P/C-G. We want to understand how the progressive modification of 67P's surface due to cometary activity might have affected the characteristics of pits. In particular, we aim to understand whether signatures of the formation mechanism of these morphological features can still be identified. To quantify the amount of erosion sustained at the surface of 67P since it arrived on its currently observed orbit, we selected 380 facets of a medium-resolution shape model of the nucleus, sampling 30 pits across the surface. We computed the surface energy balance with a high temporal resolution, including shadowing and self-heating. We then applied a thermal evolution model to assess the amount of erosion sustained after ten orbital revolutions under current illumination conditions. We find that the maximum erosion sustained after ten orbital revolutions is on the order of 80 m, for facets located in the southern hemisphere. We thus confirm that progressive erosion cannot form pits and alcoves, as local erosion is much lower than their observed depth and diameter. We find that plateaus tend to erode more than bottoms, especially for the deepest depressions, and that some differential erosion can affect their morphology. As a general rule, our results suggest that sharp morphological features tend to be erased by progressive erosion. This study supports the assumption that deep circular pits, such as Seth1, are the least processed morphological features at the surface of 67P, or the best preserved since their formation.},

Also, CH3OH was searched for in two comets. The HCN sample includes the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov. For the short-period comet 46P/Wirtanen, we were able to monitor the variation of HCN emission over a time-span of about one month.

  abstract = {We present the results of a search for outer Solar System objects in the full six years of data (``Y6'') from the Dark Energy Survey (DES ). The DES covered a contiguous 5000 deg2 of the southern sky with {$\approx$} 80, 000 3 deg2 exposures in the grizY optical/IR filters between 2013 and 2019. This search yielded 815 trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), one Centaur and one Oort cloud comet, with 461 objects reported for the first time in this paper. We present the search methodology that builds upon our previous search carried out on the first four years of data (``Y4''). Here, all DES images were reprocessed with an improved detection pipeline that leads to an average completeness gain of 0.47 mag per exposure, as well as an improved transient catalog production and optimized algorithms for linkage of such detections into Solar System orbits. All objects reported herein were verified by visual inspection and by computing the ``sub-threshold significance'', namely the total signal-to-noise ratio in the stack of images in which the object's presence is indicated by the orbit fit, but no detection was reported. This yields a highly pure catalog of trans-Neptunian objects complete to r {$\approx$} 23.8 mag and distances 29 {$<$} d {$<$} 2500 au. The Y6 TNOs have minimum (median) of 7 (12) distinct nights' detections and arcs of 1.1 (4.2) years, and will have grizY magnitudes available in a further publication. We present publicly available software for simulating our observational biases that enable comparisons of population models to our TNO detections. Initial inferences demonstrating the statistical power of the DES Y6 catalog are: the data are inconsistent with the CFEPS-L7 model for the classical Kuiper Belt; the 16 ``extreme'' TNOs (a {$>$} 150 au, q {$>$} 30 au) are consistent with the null hypothesis of azimuthal isotropy; and non-resonant TNOs with q {$>$} 38 au, a {$>$} 50 au show a highly significant tendency to be sunward of the major mean motion resonances, as expected in models of resonance sweeping, whereas this tendency is not present for q {$<$} 38 au.},

The amount of measured properties (e.g., diameter, taxonomy, rotation period, thermal inertia) has grown even faster. However, this wealth of information is spread over a myriad of articles, under many different designations per object. We provide a solution to the identification of Solar system objects from any of their multiple names or designations. We also compile and rationalize their properties to provide an easy access to them. We aim to continuously update the database as new measurements become available. We built a Web Service, SsODNet, that offers four access points, each corresponding to an identified necessity in the community: name resolution (quaero), compilation of a large corpus of properties (datacloud), determination of the best estimate among compiled values (ssoCard), and statistical description of the population (ssoBFT). The SsODNet interfaces are fully operational and freely accessible to everyone. The name resolver quaero translates any of the \textasciitilde 5.3 million designations of objects into their current official designation. The datacloud compiles about 105 million parameters (osculating and proper elements, pair and family membership, diameter, albedo, mass, density, rotation period, spin coordinates, phase function parameters, colors, taxonomy, thermal inertia, and Yarkovsky drift) from over 3,000 articles (and growing). For each of the known asteroids and dwarf planets (\textasciitilde 1.2 million), a ssoCard providing a single best-estimate for each parameter is available. The SsODNet service provides these resources in a fraction of second upon query. Finally, the large ssoBFT table compiles all the best-estimates in a single table for population-wide studies.},

Using the Lomb\textendash Scargle periodogram, we found that the most probable periodicity deduced from the V-band magnitudes is 2.70 days, suggesting that it is the period of rotation of the nucleus of this comet is 2.70 {$\pm$} 0.07 days or 68 {$\pm$} 2 h, with a peak-to-peak light curve amplitude of 0.4 {$\pm$} 0.1 magnitudes. We verify that the absolute magnitude H0 and the activity index n differ from each other when they are calculated from the visual or CCD magnitudes. Considering the absolute magnitude Hv0 = 6.0, obtained from visual magnitudes, we estimate that the lower limit of nuclear radius is 1.3 km. Analyzing the variation of magnitude R with the photometric aperture, we suggest that the coma of this object was in steady-state within the time limits of our observational interval. The coma had a mean color index B\textendash V= 0.79 {$\pm$} 0.22{$\mkern1mu$}, which is typical of active comets. Additionally, we have shown that the use of a variable photometric aperture, linked to geocentric distance, is probably unnecessary for the comet PANSTARRS .},

  abstract = {Two-body interactions play a major role in shaping the structural and dynamical properties of globular clusters (GCs) over their long-term evolution. In particular, GCs evolve towards a state of partial energy equipartition that induces a mass dependence in their kinematics. By using a set of Monte Carlo cluster simulations evolved in quasi-isolation, we show that the stellar mass dependence of the velocity dispersion {$\sigma$} (m) can be described by an exponential function {$\sigma$} 2 {$\propto$} exp (-m/meq), with the parameter meq quantifying the degree of partial energy equipartition of the systems. This simple parametrization successfully captures the behaviour of the velocity dispersion at lower as well as higher stellar masses, that is, the regime where the system is expected to approach full equipartition. We find a tight correlation between the degree of equipartition reached by a GC and its dynamical state, indicating that clusters that are more than about 20 core relaxation times old, have reached a maximum degree of equipartition. This equipartition\textendash dynamical state relation can be used as a tool to characterize the relaxation condition of a cluster with a kinematic measure of the meq parameter. Vice versa, the mass dependence of the kinematics can be predicted knowing the relaxation time solely on the basis of photometric measurements. Moreover, any deviations from this tight relation could be used as a probe of a peculiar dynamical history of a cluster. Finally, our novel approach is important for the interpretation of state-of-the-art Hubble Space Telescope proper motion data, for which the mass dependence of kinematics can now be measured, and for the application of modelling techniques which take into consideration multimass components and mass segregation.},

  abstract = {The surface granularity of small Solar System bodies is diverse through the different types of planetary bodies and even for specific objects it is often not known in detail. One of the physical properties that strongly depends on the surface structure is the surface temperature. In highly porous media with large voids, radiation can efficiently transport heat, whereas more compact, micro-porous structures transport the heat primarily by conduction through the solid material. In this work, we investigate under which conditions a macro-porous surface can be distinguished from a micro-porous one by simply measuring the surface temperature. In our numerical simulations, we included circular and elliptical orbits with and without obliquity and varied the rotation period of the considered objects. We found that daily temperature cycles are rather insensitive to the specific surface granularity. However, the surface temperature at sunrise shows significant dependency on the material structure and this effect becomes even more pronounced when the solar intensity increases. By measuring the sunrise temperature as a function of insolation at noon, a differentiation between micro- and macro-granular surface structures is possible. In this paper, we provide a strategy how remote sensing can be used to derive the surface structure of small Solar System bodies.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of dust emission from a cometary nucleus is still an open question and thermophysical models have problems reproducing outgassing and dust productions rates simultaneously. In this study, we investigate the capabilities of a rather simple thermophysical model to match observations from Rosetta instruments at comet 67P/Churyumov\textendash Gerasimenko and the influence of model variations. We assume a macroporous surface structure composed of pebbles and investigate the influence of different model assumptions. Besides the scenario in which dust layers are ejected when the vapour pressure overcomes the tensile strength, we use artificial ejection mechanisms, depending on ice depletion of layers. We find that dust activity following the pressure criterion is only possible for reduced tensile strength values or reduced gas diffusivity and is inconsistent with observed outgassing rates, because activity is driven by CO2. Only when we assume that dust activity is triggered when the layer is completely depleted in H2O, the ratio of CO2 to H2O outgassing rates is in the expected order of magnitude. However, the dust-to-H2O ratio is never reproduced. Only with decreased gas diffusivity, the slope of the H2O outgassing rate is matched, however absolute values are too low. To investigate maximum reachable pressures, we adapted our model equivalent to a gas-impermeable dust structure. Here, pressures exceeding the tensile strength by orders of magnitude are possible. Maximum activity distances of \$3.1\$, \$8.2\$, and \$74 \textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{au\}\$ were estimated for H2O-, CO2-, and CO-driven activity of \$1\textbackslash hbox\{-\}\textbackslash mathrm\{cm\}\$-sized dust, respectively. In conclusion, the mechanism behind dust emission remains unclear.},

The NASA Deep Impact mission reached the comet on 4.24 July 2005, delivering a 370-kg impactor which hit the comet at 10.3 km s-1. Following this impact, a cloud of gas and dust was excavated from the comet nucleus. The comet was observed in 2005 prior to and after the impact, at 18-cm wavelength with the Nan\c{c}ay radio telescope, in the millimeter range with the IRAM and CSO radio telescopes, and at 557 GHz with the Odin satellite. OH observations at Nan\c{c}ay provided a 4-month monitoring of the outgassing of the comet from March to June, followed by the observation of H2O with Odin from June to August 2005. The peak of outgassing was found to be around 1 \texttimes{} 1028 molec. s-1 between May and July.

J. 641, L145\textendash L148], is consistent with a rotation period of the nucleus of 1.715 days and a strong variation of the outgassing activity by a factor 3 from minimum to maximum. This also implies that the impact took place on the rising phase of the ``natural'' outgassing which reached its maximum {$\approx$}4 h after the impact. Post-impact observations at IRAM and CSO did not reveal a significant change of the outgassing rates and relative abundances, with the exception of CH3OH which may have been more abundant by up to one order of magnitude in the ejecta. Most other variations are linked to the intrinsic variability of the comet. The Odin satellite monitored nearly continuously the H2O line at 557 GHz during the 38 h following the impact on the 4th of July, in addition to weekly monitoring. Once the periodic variations related to the nucleus rotation are removed, a small increase of outgassing related to the impact is present, which corresponds to the release of {$\approx$}5000 {$\pm$} 2000 tons of water. Two other bursts of activity, also observed at other wavelengths, were seen on 23 June and 7 July; they correspond to even larger releases of gas.},

We report on observations of HCN, CH\_3OH, CO, H\_2CO, CS, and H\_2S and on the evolution of their production rates with heliocentric distance (r\_h), from 1.86 down to 0.24 AU at perihelion. Most production rates increased roughly as r\^-2.2\_h down to 0.6 AU preperihelion. Closer to the Sun, they stalled before decreasing beyond 0.6 AU postperihelion, when observations resumed. The CS/HCN ratio varied as r\^-0.8\_h from 1.2 to 0.24 AU. A rapid increase of the mean gas temperature in the coma is measured, and the gas expansion velocity increased from 0.55 to 1.6 km s\^-1, as the comet approached the Sun from 1.6 to 0.3 AU. Molecular abundances of the minor species around 1 AU are similar to those observed in other comets, while the CO abundance relative to water is high (\textasciitilde 22\%). Coarse mapping was used to check the comet's position and to investigate the density distribution of the molecules within the coma. It provides constraints on the size of the extended source of formaldehyde, found to be between 1.2 and 2 times the scale length of H\_2CO itself. The density distribution of CS is compatible with its production from the photodissociation of a short-lived molecule such as CS\_2. The density distribution observed for CO can be mostly explained by a nuclear source.},

From a spectral molecular survey, six new cometary molecular species have been identified for the first time in a comet: SO, SO\_2, HC\_3N, NH\_2CHO, HCOOH, and HCOOCH\_3. Relative abundances with respect to water are 0.3\% (SO), 0.2\% (SO\_2), 0.02\% (HC\_3N), 0.01-0.02\% (NH\_2CHO), 0.09\% (HCOOH), and 0.08\% (HCOOCH\_3). Several rotational transitions of OCS and HNCO, whose first identifications were made previously in comet C/1996 B2 (Hyakutake), have also been detected, confirming that these molecular species are ubiquitous compounds of cometary atmospheres. Inferred abundances of OCS and HNCO relative to water in comet Hale-Bopp are 0.4\% and 0.1\%, respectively. During this observational campaign, we also observed rotational lines of HCN, HNC, CH\_3CN, CO, CH\_3OH, H\_2CO, H\_2S, and CS. In combination with results of other observations, a comprehensive view of the volatile composition of the coma of comet Hale-Bopp is obtained. A quantitative comparison shows that chemical abundances in comet Hale-Bopp parallel those inferred in interstellar ices, hot molecular cores and bipolar flows around protostars. This suggests that the processes at work in the interstellar medium, in particular grain surface chemistry, played a major role in the formation of cometary ices. It supports models in which cometary volatiles formed in the interstellar medium and suffered little processing in the Solar Nebula.},

  abstract = {Methods. We used the HIFI, PACS and SPIRE instruments of the Herschel space observatory on several dates in 2010, 2011, and 2013 to observe the H2O 557 GHz and NH3 573 GHz lines and to image the dust coma in the far-infrared. Observations with the IRAM 30 m telescope were undertaken in 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2021 to monitor the CO production rate through the 230 GHz line, and to search for HCN at 89 GHz. The 70 and 160 \textmu m PACS images were used to measure the thermal flux from the nucleus and the dust coma. Modeling was performed to constrain the size of the sublimating icy grains and to derive the dust production rate. Results. HCN is detected for the first time in comet 29P (at 5{$\sigma$} in the line area). H2O is detected as well, but not NH3. H2O and HCN line shapes differ strongly from the CO line shape, indicating that these two species are released from icy grains. CO production rates are in the range (2.9\textendash 5.6) \texttimes{} 1028 s-1 (1400\textendash 2600 kg s-1). A correlation between the CO production rate and coma brightness is observed, as is a correlation between CO and H2O production. The correlation obtained between the excess of CO production and excess of dust brightness with respect to the quiescent state is similar to that established for the continuous activity of comet Hale-Bopp. The measured Q(H2O)/Q(CO) and Q(HCN)/Q(CO) production rate ratios are 10.0 {$\pm$} 1.5 \% and 0.12 {$\pm$} 0.03 \%, respectively, averaging the April-May 2010 measurements (Q(H2O) = (4.1 {$\pm$} 0.6) \texttimes{} 1027 s-1, Q(HCN) = (4.8 {$\pm$} 1.1) \texttimes{} 1025 s-1). We derive three independent and similar values of the effective radius of the nucleus, {$\sim$}31 {$\pm$} 3 km, suggesting an approximately spherical shape. The inferred dust massloss rates during quiescent phases are in the range 30\textendash 120 kg s-1, indicating a dust-to-gas mass ratio {$<$}0.1 during quiescent activity. We conclude that strong local heterogeneities exist on the surface of 29P, with quenched dust activity from most of the surface, but not in outbursting regions. Conclusions. The volatile composition of the atmosphere of 29P strongly differs from that of comets observed within 3 au from the Sun. The observed correlation between CO, H2O and dust activity may provide important constraints for the outburst-triggering mechanism.},

We focus on spectral modeling, observational opportunities, and anticipated challenges in the interpretation of new observations, based on our current understanding of the atomic and molecular processes occurring in the atmospheres of small, icy bodies. Close to the surface, comets possess a thermalized atmosphere that traces the irregular shape of the nucleus. Gravity is too low to retain the gas, which flows out to form a large, collisionless exosphere (coma) that interacts with the heliospheric radiation environment. As such, cometary comae represent conditions that are familiar in the context of planetary atmosphere studies. However, the outer comae are tenuous, with densities lower than those found in vacuum chambers on Earth. Comets, therefore, provide us with unique natural laboratories that can be understood using state-of-the-art theoretical treatments of the relevant microphysical processes. Radiative processes offer direct diagnostics of the local physical conditions, as well as the macroscopic coma properties.These can be used to improve our understanding of comets and other astrophysical environments such as icy moons and the interstellar medium.},

The main goal was the size estimation of the nuclei through broadband CCD imaging when the comets were far from the Sun (26P/GS: 3.8 AU in September 1993, 73P/SW3: 3.0 AU in December 1994). The nucleus of 26P/GS has an equivalent radius of 1.5 km (for an albedo of 0.04) with a body axis ratio of 0.9 or less (considering other observations possibly just 0.5 or less). The comet was inactive at 3.8 AU outbound and exhibited a slightly bluish V-R colour. Comet 73P/SW3 was smaller than 1.1 km radius (for an albedo of 0.04) before break-up in 1995 and showed solar V-R colour. The nucleus was weakly active at 3.0 AU inbound in December 1994. The gas production rates measured during the perihelion passages of the comets in 1992 (26P/GS) and 1995 (73P/SW3) together with our radius estimations suggest that the nuclei of both comets had a significant crust coverage on their surface.},

The main goal was the size estimation of the nuclei through broadband CCD imaging when the comets were far from the Sun (26P/GS: 3.8 AU in September 1993, 73P/SW3: 3.0 AU in December 1994). The nucleus of 26P/GS has an equivalent radius of 1.5 km (for an albedo of 0.04) with a body axis ratio of 0.9 or less (considering other observations possibly just 0.5 or less). The comet was inactive at 3.8 AU outbound and exhibited a slightly bluish V-R colour. Comet 73P/SW3 was smaller than 1.1 km radius (for an albedo of 0.04) before break-up in 1995 and showed solar V-R colour. The nucleus was weakly active at 3.0 AU inbound in December 1994. The gas production rates measured during the perihelion passages of the comets in 1992 (26P/GS) and 1995 (73P/SW3) together with our radius estimations suggest that the nuclei of both comets had a significant crust coverage on their surface.

  abstract = {Methods. Broadband imaging photometry and broadband and narrowband linear polarimetry is measured for the nucleus of 2P/Encke over the phase-angle range 4-28 deg. Results. An analysis of the point spread function of the comet in polarimetric images reveal only weak coma activity in 2P/Encke, corresponding to dust production of the order of 0.05 kg/s. Over the measured phase-angle range the nucleus displays a color independent photometric phase function of almost linear slope ({$\beta$} = 0.050 {$\pm$} 0.004 mag/deg). The absolute R filter magnitude at zero phase angle is 15.05 {$\pm$} 0.05 mag and corresponds to an equivalent radius for the nucleus of 2.43 {$\pm$} 0.06 km (adopted albedo of 0.047). The nucleus color V - R was measured to be 0.47 {$\pm$} 0.07, suggesting a spectral slope S of 11 {$\pm$} 8\%/100 nm. The phase function of linear polarimetry in the V and R filter shows a widely color independent linear increase with phase angle (0.12 {$\pm$} 0.02\%/deg). The test of the empirical albedo-polarization relationship for asteroids reveals unreasonably high albedo values for the nucleus. We find discrepancies in the photometric and polarimetric parameters between 2P/Encke and other minor bodies in the solar system, which may indicate significant differences in the surface material properties and light-scattering behavior of the bodies. Conclusions. The linear polarimetric phase function of 2P/Encke presented here is the first ever measured for a cometary nucleus. It provides encouragement to future studies of cometary nuclei in order to characterize the light-scattering behavior of comets on firm empirical grounds and provide suitable input to a comprehensive modeling of the light scattering by cometary surfaces.},

  abstract = {More than 40 split comets have been observed over the past 150 years. Two of the split comets have disappeared completely; another one was destroyed during its impact on Jupiter. The analysis of the postsplitting dynamics of fragments suggests that nucleus splitting can occur at large heliocentric distances (certainly beyond 50 AU) for long-period and new comets and all along the orbit for short-period comets. Various models for split comets have been proposed, but only in one peculiar case, the break-up of Comet D/1993 F2 (Shoemaker-Levy 9) around Jupiter, has a splitting mechanism been fully understood: The nucleus of D/1993 F2 was disrupted by tidal forces. The fragments of split comets seem to be subkilometer in size. It is, however, not clear whether they are cometesimals that formed during the early formation history of the planetary system or are pieces from a heavily processed surface crust of the parent body. The two basic types of comet splitting (few fragments and many fragments) may require different model interpretations. Disappearing comets may represent rare cases of complete nucleus dissolution as suggested by the prototype case, Comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR). At least one large family of split comets exists - the Kreutz group- but other smaller clusters of comets with common parent bodies are very likely. Comet splitting seems to be an efficient process of mass loss of the nucleus and thus can play an important role in the evolution of comets toward their terminal state. The secondary nuclei behave as comets of their own (with activity, coma, and tail) exhibiting a wide range of lifetimes. However, at present it is now known whether the fragments' terminal state is "completely dissolved" or "exhausted and inactive."},

May 1999: no coma was detected at heliocentric distance r = 4.98 AU.

The nucleus signal varies during the 2.7 h observing interval and a peak-to-peak amplitude of {$\sim$}0.38 mag is determined. The measured lightcurve is in agreement with a rotation period of 6\textendash 7.5 hours and a ratio of the main nucleus axes of at least 1.4. The non-detection of a coma allows one to put an approximate upper limit for Af{$\rho$} of {$<$}0.45 cm (suggesting a dust production rate of 0.05 kg/s). December 2001: a weak and condensed coma seems to be present in the seeing disk of the comet at 2.9 AU inbound, causing a higher brightness than expected from the previous size estimates of the nucleus. The colour of the comet appears very red (V - R spectral gradient {$\sim$}47\%/100 nm).

Assuming a Haser profile with constant outflow velocity, we model the line intensity of each transition using a 3D radiative transfer code and derive molecular production rates and parent scale lengths. Results. We report the first detection of CS in comet ISON obtained with the ALMA array and derive a parent scale length for CS of {$\sim$}200 km. Due to the high spatial resolution of ALMA, resulting in a synthesised beam with a size slightly smaller than the derived parent scale length (0 . 59 \texttimes{} 0 . 39 corresponding to {$\sim$}(375 \texttimes{} 250) km at the distance of the comet at the time of observations), we are able to tentatively identify CS as a daughter species, i.e., a species produced in the coma and/or sublimated from icy grains, rather than a parent species. In addition we report the detection of several CH3OH transitions and confirm the previously reported detections of HCN, HNC and H2CO as well as dust in the coma of each comet, and report 3{$\sigma$} upper limits for HCO+. Conclusions. We derive molecular production rates relative to water of 0.2\% for CS, 0.06\textendash 0.1\% for HCN, 0.003\textendash 0.05\% for HNC, 0.1\textendash 0.2\% for H2CO and 0.5\textendash 1.0\% for CH3OH, and show that the modelling uncertainties due to unknown collision rates and kinematic temperatures are modest and can be mitigated by available observations of different transitions of HCN.},

It is possible, therefore, that the colour distribution of NTs is a constraint on the location of any colour transition zones that may have been present in the disk. In support of this possible test, we obtained \$g\$, \$r\$, and \$i\$-band observations of 18 NTs, more than doubling the sample of NTs with known visible colours to 31 objects. Out of the combined sample, we found \$\textbackslash approx\$4 objects with \$g\$-\$i\$ colours of \${$>\$$}1.2 mags placing them in the very red (VR) category as typically defined. We find, without taking observational selection effects into account, that the NT \$g\$-\$i\$ colour distribution is statistically distinct from other trans-Neptunian dynamical classes. The optical colours of Jovian Trojans and NTs are shown to be less similar than previously claimed with additional VR NTs. The presence of VR objects among the NTs may suggest that the location of the red to VR colour transition zone in the protoplanetary disk was interior to 30-35 au.},

  abstract = {A major upgrade to the NIRSPEC instrument at the Keck II telescope was successfully completed in time for nearinfrared spectroscopic observations of comet 46P/Wirtanen during its exceptionally close flyby of Earth in 2018 December. These studies determined the abundances of several volatiles, including C2H2, C2H6, CH3OH, NH3, HCN, H2CO, and H2O. Long-slit spatial distributions of gas rotational temperature and column density are diagnostic for the presence of icy grains in the coma and understanding if different volatiles are associated with common or distinct outgassing sources. These spatial distributions suggest that C2H2, C2H6, and HCN have a common outgassing source, whereas H2O and CH3OH have additional, more extended sources. The synergy of these findings with observations by space missions (Rosetta and EPOXI) motivates continuing studies to address whether or not C2H6, C2H2, and HCN have a common source of release (plausibly associated with CO2) in a larger sample of comets and whether systematic differences exist in the release of these species compared to H2O and CH3OH. Abundances of volatiles are reported relative to H2O, as traditionally done, as well as C2H6. While not unique, the choice of C2H6 demonstrates the value of extending the chemical taxonomy of parent volatiles in comets toward additional compositional ``baselines'' and, importantly, closer integration between coma abundances and the underlying volatile associations as revealed by spatial distributions. Our findings on composition and sources of outgassing include information relevant to future evaluations of 46P/Wirtanen as a prospective spacecraft target.},

Parallel to the rotational properties we did numerical dynamical simulations to investigate the orbital stability of those objects and to find out if there is a relation with their rotational properties. Our results show that the orbit stability is affected by the orbit itself and mainly its eccentricity and inclination, which are responsible for the close encounters with other Solar system planets. We cannot make a definitive conclusion about the relation between orbit stability and the rotational state of the asteroids, so we need further investigations and observations in order to prove or disprove it.},

  abstract = {Meteoroids impacting the Earth on a daily basis are fragments of asteroids and comets. By studying fireballs produced during their disintegration in the atmosphere, we can gain information about their source regions and the properties of their parent bodies. In this work, data on 824 fireballs presented in an accompanying paper and catalog are used. We propose a new empirical parameter for the classification of the physical properties of meteoroids, based on the maximum dynamic pressure suffered by the meteoroid in the atmosphere. We then compare the physical and orbital properties of meteoroids. We find that aphelion distance is a better indicator of asteroidal origin than the Tisserand parameter. Meteoroids with aphelia lower than 4.9 AU are mostly asteroidal, with the exception of the Taurids and alpha Capricornids associated with the comets 2P/Encke and 169P/NEAT, respectively. We found another population of strong meteoroids of probably asteroidal origin on orbits with either high eccentricities or high inclinations, and aphelia up to \textasciitilde{} 7 AU. Among the meteoroid streams, the Geminids and eta Virginids are the strongest, and Leonids and alpha Capricornids the weakest. We found fine orbital structures within the Geminid and Perseid streams. Four minor meteoroid streams from the working list of the International Astronomical Union were confirmed. No meteoroid with perihelion distance lower than 0.07 AU was detected. Spectra are available for some of the fireballs, and they enabled us to identify several iron meteoroids and meteoroids deficient in sodium. Recognition and frequency of fireballs leading to meteorite falls is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Planet formation models suggest the primordial main belt experienced a short but intense period of collisional evolution shortly after the formation of planetary embryos. This period is believed to have lasted until Jupiter reached its full size, when dynamical processes (e.g., sweeping resonances, excitation via planetary embryos) ejected most planetesimals from the main belt zone. The few planetesimals left behind continued to undergo comminution at a reduced rate until the present day. We investigated how this scenario affects the main belt size distribution over Solar System history using a collisional evolution model (CoEM) that accounts for these events. CoEM does not explicitly include results from dynamical models, but instead treats the unknown size of the primordial main belt and the nature/timing of its dynamical depletion using innovative but approximate methods. Model constraints were provided by the observed size frequency distribution of the asteroid belt, the observed population of asteroid families, the cratered surface of differentiated Asteroid (4) Vesta, and the relatively constant crater production rate of the Earth and Moon over the last 3 Gyr. Using CoEM, we solved for both the shape of the initial main belt size distribution after accretion and the asteroid disruption scaling law QD{${_\ast}$}. In contrast to previous efforts, we find our derived QD{${_\ast}$} function is very similar to results produced by numerical hydrocode simulations of asteroid impacts. Our best fit results suggest the asteroid belt experienced as much comminution over its early history as it has since it reached its low-mass state approximately 3.9-4.5 Ga. These results suggest the main belt's wavy-shaped size-frequency distribution is a "fossil" from this violent early epoch. We find that most diameter D{$\greaterequivlnt$}120 km asteroids are primordial, with their physical properties likely determined during the accretion epoch. Conversely, most smaller asteroids are byproducts of fragmentation events. The observed changes in the asteroid spin rate and lightcurve distributions near D{$\sim$}100-120 km are likely to be a byproduct of this difference. Estimates based on our results imply the primordial main belt population (in the form of D{$<$}1000 km bodies) was 150-250 times larger than it is today, in agreement with recent dynamical simulations.},

With this as motivation, we constructed a simple model that takes a detailed account of gas transport modes and simulates the time-dependent sublimation of super-volatile ice from beneath a porous mantle on an incoming cometary nucleus. The model reveals a localized increase in carbon monoxide (CO) sublimation close to heliocentric distance rH = 150 AU (local blackbody temperature {$\sim$}23 K), followed by a plateau and then a slow increase in activity towards smaller distances. This localized increase occurs as heat transport in the nucleus transitions between two regimes characterized by the rising temperature of the CO front at larger distances and nearly isothermal CO at smaller distances. As this transition is a general property of sublimation through a porous mantle, we predict that future observations of sufficient sensitivity will show that in-bound comets (and interstellar interlopers) will exhibit activity at distances far beyond the planetary region of the solar system.},

  abstract = {The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) dataset will dramatically alter our understanding of the Universe, from the origins of the Solar System to the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Much of this research will depend on the existence of robust, tested, and scalable algorithms, software, and services. Identifying and developing such tools ahead of time has the potential to significantly accelerate the delivery of early science from LSST. Developing these collaboratively, and making them broadly available, can enable more inclusive and equitable collaboration on LSST science. To facilitate such opportunities, a community workshop entitled "From Data to Software to Science with the Rubin Observatory LSST" was organized by the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) and partners, and held at the Flatiron Institute in New York, March 28-30th 2022. The workshop included over 50 in-person attendees invited from over 300 applications. It identified seven key software areas of need: (i) scalable cross-matching and distributed joining of catalogs, (ii) robust photometric redshift determination, (iii) software for determination of selection functions, (iv) frameworks for scalable time-series analyses, (v) services for image access and reprocessing at scale, (vi) object image access (cutouts) and analysis at scale, and (vii) scalable job execution systems. This white paper summarizes the discussions of this workshop. It considers the motivating science use cases, identified cross-cutting algorithms, software, and services, their high-level technical specifications, and the principles of inclusive collaborations needed to develop them. We provide it as a useful roadmap of needs, as well as to spur action and collaboration between groups and individuals looking to develop reusable software for early LSST science.},

In our hypothesis, the initial bulk compositions of the bodies themselves can be quite diverse\textemdash as is seen in comets\textemdash but the early surface compositions are set by volatile evaporation after the objects are formed. Strong gradients in surface composition, coupled with UV and particle irradiation, lead to the surface colors that are seen today. The objects formed in the inner part of the primordial belt retain only H2O and CO2 as the major ice species on their surfaces. Irradiation of these species plausibly results in the dark neutrally colored centaurs and Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). Object formed further in the disk retain CH3OH, which has been shown to lead to brighter redder surfaces after irradiation, as seen in the brighter redder centaurs and KBOs. Objects formed at the current location of the cold classical Kuiper belt uniquely retain NH3, which has been shown to affect irradiation chemistry and could plausibly lead to the unique colors of these objects. We propose observational and experimental tests of this hypothesis.},

Here, we interpret (22) Kalliope in the context of bodies in its surroundings. While there is a known moon Linus, with a 5:1 size ratio, no family has been reported in the literature, which is in contradiction with the existence of the moon. Using the hierarchical clustering method (HCM) along with physical data, we identified the Kalliope family. Previously, it was associated to (7481) San Marcello. We then used various models (N-body, Monte-Carlo, SPH) of its orbital and collisional evolution, including the break-up of the parent body, to estimate the dynamical age of the family and address its link to Linus. The best-fit age is (900+-100) My according to our collisional model, in agreement with the position of (22) Kalliope, which was modified by chaotic diffusion due to 4-1-1 three-body resonance with Jupiter and Saturn. It seems possible to create Linus and the Kalliope family at the same time, although our SPH simulations show a variety of outcomes, for both satellite size and the family size-frequency distribution. The shape of (22) Kalliope itself was most likely affected by gravitational reaccumulation of `streams', which creates characteristic hills observed on the surface. If the body was differentiated, its internal structure is surely asymmetric.},

If the population of classical KBOs have a powerlaw size distribution as the ones that are inferred from recent observational surveys, the fraction of surviving binaries at present would be {$\sim$}70 per cent of the primordial population. The orbits of the surviving synthetic systems match reasonably well the observed sample. The collisional process excites the mutual orbital eccentricity of the binaries, acting against the effect of tides. Therefore only {$\sim$}10 per cent of the objects reach total orbital circularization (e {$\leq$} 10-4). In addition, our results predict that the population of contact binaries in the transneptunian region should be small. Ultrawide binaries are naturally obtained by the combined action of Kozai cycles and tidal friction and collisional evolution, being the number and orbital distribution of them very similar to the ones of the observed population.},

  abstract = {Large clasts are common on extraterrestrial bodies, and these are traditionally termed ``blocks'' and ``boulders''. These two terms can easily raise confusion, however, because they are used in a sense that differs from geological definitions. Several classifications of large clasts are currently in use in the Earth sciences, and they differ only in detail. They restrict the size of boulders to 1\textendash 4 m; larger particles are called "megaclasts". The analysis of the published information on large clasts on planet satellites, asteroids, and comets imply that the particles often described as "boulders" actually are megaclasts; boulders, as the term is used in the Earth sciences, are too small to be detected given the limited resolution of most images obtained. It were therefore scientifically preferable if the established geological literature were applied in the modern planetary and space research. It appears sensible to distinguish boulders from megaclasts; the latter comprise bodies that might be subdivided granulometrically into blocks, megablocks, and superblocks. It is also shown that the abundance of megaclasts on extraterrestrial bodies may itself be beneficial for our understanding of such particles, which are rare on Earth.},

In this work we explore radial color distributions in the primordial planetesimal disk and implications for the positions of ice line/color transitions within the Kuiper belt's progenitor populations. We combine a full dynamical model of the Kuiper belt's evolution due to Neptune's migration with precise surface colors measured by the Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey in order to examine the true color ratios within the Kuiper belt and the ice lines within the primordial disk. We investigate the position of a dominant, surface color changing ice-line, with two possible surface color layouts within the initial disk; (1) inner neutral surfaces and outer red, and (2) inner red surfaces and outer neutral. We performed simulations with a primordial disk that truncates at 30 au. By radially stepping the color transition out through 0.5 au intervals we show that both disk configurations are consistent with the observed color fraction. For an inner neutral, outer red primordial disk we find that the color transition can be at 28+-23 au at a 95\% confidence level. For an inner red, outer neutral primordial disk the color transition can be at 27+-33 au at a 95\% confidence level.},

The project of determining an asteroid's phase curve is challenging because it combines four photometric objectives: determination of the asteroid's rotational lightcurve, monitoring the asteroid over a wide range of solar phase angles, high photometric accuracy, and FOV bridging or ``all-sky'' photometry to link the asteroid's brightness from night to night. All of these are important because the different shapes of phase curves (caused by different surface characteristics) have a subtle effect. The typical phase curve project requires photometric accuracy of about {$\pm$}0.03 mag or better; commits the observatory to a dozen nights, spread over about 2 months; and commits the astronomer to a set of data analyses that is significantly more extensive than is required for a typical ``differential photometry rotational lightcurve'' project. In this paper I will describe how I have gathered the necessary data, the procedures for data reduction, and some challenges in determining the slope parameter G.},

Knowing this, and the fact that this object appears to brighten in excess of it's predicted nucleus brightness suggests that 2009 MS9 has a delayed onset of activity brought on by the sublimation of a species more volatile than water. In this paper we characterize 2009 MS9's physical properties and investigate potential outgassing through composite images, sublimation models, and measurements of spectral reflectivity. We find that deep composite images of the object at various epochs along its orbit show no evidence of dust yet place sensitive limits to the dust production. We estimate the nucleus radius to be 11.5 km \$\textbackslash pm 3.5\$ km using thermal IR modeling from NEOWISE data and use this and data pre-perihelion to estimate a geometric albedo of 0.25. We compare a CO-sublimation activity model to its post perihelion heliocentric light curve and find this data supports an active fractional area of \$5 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-6\}\$ assuming 2 \$\textbackslash mu\$m sized grains and other typical comet parameters. The spectral reflectivity of the surface materials obtained with the Gemini Observatory and CFHT at different epochs shows a reddening spectral slope. We compare the physical properties of 2009 MS9 to both TNO and comet populations, and speculate that 2009 MS9's reddening may be due to the buildup of a dust mantle on the surface and could be an explanation of why TNOs exhibit a color bimodality.},

  abstract = {We present the results from four stellar occultations by (486958) Arrokoth, the flyby target of the New Horizons extended mission. Three of the four efforts led to positive detections of the body, and all constrained the presence of rings and other debris, finding none. Twenty-five mobile stations were deployed for 2017 June 3 and augmented by fixed telescopes. There were no positive detections from this effort. The event on 2017 July 10 was observed by the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy with one very short chord. Twenty-four deployed stations on 2017 July 17 resulted in five chords that clearly showed a complicated shape consistent with a contact binary with rough dimensions of 20 by 30 km for the overall outline. A visible albedo of 10\% was derived from these data. Twenty-two systems were deployed for the fourth event on 2018 August 4 and resulted in two chords. The combination of the occultation data and the flyby results provides a significant refinement of the rotation period, now estimated to be 15.9380{$\pm$}0.0005 hr. The occultation data also provided high-precision astrometric constraints on the position of the object that were crucial for supporting the navigation for the New Horizons flyby. This work demonstrates an effective method for obtaining detailed size and shape information and probing for rings and dust on distant Kuiper Belt objects as well as being an important source of positional data that can aid in spacecraft navigation that is particularly useful for small and distant bodies.},

Their discovery and cataloguing also have strong practical implications to life on Earth as the nearest asteroids could pose a serious impact threat. Concurrently with dedicated observational projects, searches for small bodies have been performed on numerous archival data sets from different facilities. Here, we present a framework to increase the scientific return of an exoplanet transit-search survey by recovering serendipitous detections of small bodies in its daily and archival data using a GPU-based synthetic tracking algorithm. As a proof of concept, we analysed \$12\textbackslash, \textbackslash times 12\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{arcmin\^2\}\$ sky fields observed by the 1-m telescopes of the SPECULOOS survey. We analysed 90 sky fields distributed uniformly across the sky as part of the daily search for small bodies and 21 archival fields located within 5\,deg from the ecliptic plane as part of the archival search (4.4\,deg2 in total). Overall, we identified 400 known objects of different dynamical classes from Inner Main-belt Asteroids to Jupiter Trojans and 43 potentially new small bodies with no priors on their motion. We were able to reach limiting magnitude for unknown objects of V = 23.8\,mag, and a retrieval rate of {$\sim$}80~per\,cent for objects with V \&lt; 22\,mag and V \&lt; 23.5\,mag for the daily and archival searches, respectively. SPECULOOS and similar exoplanet surveys can thus serve as pencil-beam surveys for small bodies and probe parameter space beyond V = 22\,mag.},

  abstract = {Optical properties are required for the correct understanding and modelling of protoplanetary and debris discs. By assuming that comets are the most pristine bodies in the solar system, our goal is to derive optical constants of real protoplanetary material. We determine the complex index of refraction of the near-surface material of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by fitting the sub-millimetre/millimetre observations of the thermal emission of the comet's sub-surface made by the Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter (MIRO) with synthetic temperatures derived from a thermophysical model and radiative-transfer models. According to the two major formation scenarios of comets, we model the sub-surface layers to consist of pebbles as well as of homogeneously packed dust grains. In the case of a homogeneous dusty surface material, we find a solution for the length-absorption coefficient of \$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash approx 0.22\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{cm\^\{-1\}\}\$ for a wavelength of 1.594 mm and \$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash geq 3.84\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{cm\^\{-1\}\}\$ for a wavelength of 0.533 mm and a constant thermal conductivity of \$0.006\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{Wm\^\{-1\}K\^\{-1\}\}\$. For the pebble scenario, we find for the pebbles and a wavelength of 1.594 mm a complex refractive index of \$n = (1.074 - 1.256) + \textbackslash mathrm\{i\} \textbackslash, (2.580 - 7.431)\textbackslash cdot 10\^\{-3\}\$ for pebble radii between 1 mm and 6 mm. Taking into account other constraints, our results point towards a pebble makeup of the cometary sub-surface with pebble radii between 3 mm and 6 mm. The derived real part of the refractive index is used to constrain the composition of the pebbles and their volume filling factor. The optical and physical properties are discussed in the context of protoplanetary and debris disc observations.},

Either they formed by collisions among planetary embryos from the inner solar system, or by accreting sunward-drifting millimeter-sized 'pebbles' from the outer solar system. We show that the isotopic compositions of Earth and Mars are governed by two-component mixing among inner solar system materials, including material from the innermost disk unsampled by meteorites, whereas the contribution of outer solar system material is limited to a few percent by mass. This refutes a pebble accretion origin of the terrestrial planets, but is consistent with collisional growth from inner solar system embryos. The low fraction of outer solar system material in Earth and Mars indicates the presence of a persistent dust-drift barrier in the disk, highlighting the specific pathway of rocky planet formation in the solar system.},

  abstract = {In 2020, over 60\% of launches to low Earth orbit resulted in one or more rocket bodies being abandoned in orbit and eventually returning to Earth in an uncontrolled manner. When they do so, between 20 and 40\% of their mass survives the heat of atmospheric reentry. Many of the surviving pieces are heavy enough to pose serious risks to people, on land, at sea, and in airplanes. There is no international consensus on the acceptable level of risk from reentering space objects. This is sometimes a point of contention, such as when a 20 tonne Long March 5B core stage made an uncontrolled reentry in May 2021. Some regulators, including the US, France, and ESA, have implemented a 1 in 10,000 acceptable casualty risk (i.e., statistical threat to human life) threshold from reentering space objects. We argue that this threshold ignores the cumulative effect of the rapidly increasing number of rocket launches. It also fails to address low risk, high consequence outcomes, such as a rocket stage crashing into a high-density city or a large passenger aircraft. In the latter case, even a small piece could cause hundreds of casualties. Compounding this, the threshold is frequently ignored or waived when the costs of adherence are deemed excessive. We analyse the rocket bodies that reentered the atmosphere from 1992 - 2021 and model the associated cumulative casualty expectation. We then extrapolate this trend into the near future (2022 - 2032), modelling the potential risk to the global population from uncontrolled rocket body reentries. We also analyse the population of rocket bodies that are currently in orbit and expected to deorbit soon, and find that the risk distribution is significantly weighted to latitudes close to the equator. This represents a disproportionate burden of casualty risk imposed on the countries of the Global South by major spacefaring countries.},

  abstract = {Several sulphur-bearing species have already been observed in different families of comets. However, the knowledge on the minor sulphur species is still limited. The comet's sulphur inventory is closely linked to the pre-solar cloud and holds important clues to the degree of reprocessing of the material in the solar nebula and during comet accretion. Sulphur in pre-solar clouds is highly depleted, which is quite puzzling as the S/O ratio in the diffuse interstellar medium is cosmic. This work focuses on the abundance of the previously known species H2S, OCS, SO, S2, SO2 and CS2 in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov\textendash Gerasimenko measured by Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis/Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer between equinox and perihelion 2015. Furthermore, we present the first detection of S3, S4, CH3SH and C2H6S in a comet, and we determine the elemental abundance of S/O in the bulk ice of (1.47 {$\pm$} 0.05) \texttimes{} 10-2. We show that SO is present in the coma originating from the nucleus, but not CS in the case of 67P, and for the first time establish that S2 is present in a volatile and a refractory phase. The derived total elemental sulphur abundance of 67P is in agreement with solar photospheric elemental abundances and shows no sulphur depletion as reported for dense interstellar clouds. Also the presence of S2 at heliocentric distances larger than 3 au indicates that sulphur-bearing species have been processed by radiolysis in the pre-solar cloud and that at least some of the ice from this cloud has survived in comets up the present.},

  abstract = {Within the dynamically cold low inclination portion of the Classical Kuiper Belt, there exists a population of weakly bound binary systems with a number of unusual properties; most notable of which is their extremely wide orbital separations; beyond 7\% of their Hill radii. The stability and evolution of these Ultra-Wide Trans-Neptunian Binaries (TNBs) have, in the past, been studied extensively under the assumption that the primary evolving mechanisms are interactions between the binary components and impacting Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs). Here, we instead study their evolution as driven by the gravitational perturbations of close passing but non-impacting TNOs. By simulating these passages, we show that the aggregate effects of encounters over billions of years have a significant effect on Kuiper Belt binary evolution. Such processes can lead to tight binaries widening significantly over time, approaching and sometimes surpassing the separation of the widest known TNBs. We also find that the eccentricity and inclination distributions of observed Ultra-Wide TNBs can be sampled from such widened binaries. While we are unable to produce enough wide binaries to explain their abundance, the orbital properties of ones we do produce are consistent with known wide binaries.},

We collected optical observations along the 2020 July\textendash November months during which the asteroid appear always star-like, without any form of perceptible activity. We found complex light curves, with low amplitude around opposition and a bit higher amplitude far opposition, with a mean best rotation period of 2.46{$\pm$}0.02 h. Shape changes were observed in the phased light curves after opposition, a probable indication of concavities and surface irregularities. We suspect the existence of an Amplitude\textendash Phase Relationship in C band. The mean colours are B - V = +0.84{$\pm$}0.04, V - Rc = +0.43{$\pm$}0.03, and B - Rc = +1.27{$\pm$}0.02, compatible with an S-type asteroid, but variables with the rotational phase index of a non-homogeneous surface composition. From our phase\textendash mag curve and Shevchenko's empirical photometric system, the geometric albedo result pV = 0.13{$\pm$}0.04, lower than the average value of the S-class. We estimate an absolute mag in V band of about + 14.9 and this, together with the albedo value, allows us to estimate a diameter of about 3\textendash 4 km, so Gault may be smaller than previously thought.},

  abstract = {We present a real-time stamp classifier of astronomical events for the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events broker, ALeRCE. The classifier is based on a convolutional neural network, trained on alerts ingested from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Using only the science, reference, and difference images of the first detection as inputs, along with the metadata of the alert as features, the classifier is able to correctly classify alerts from active galactic nuclei, supernovae (SNe), variable stars, asteroids, and bogus classes, with high accuracy ({$\sim$}94\%) in a balanced test set. In order to find and analyze SN candidates selected by our classifier from the ZTF alert stream, we designed and deployed a visualization tool called SN Hunter, where relevant information about each possible SN is displayed for the experts to choose among candidates to report to the Transient Name Server database. From 2019 June 26 to 2021 February 28, we have reported 6846 SN candidates to date (11.8 candidates per day on average), of which 971 have been confirmed spectroscopically. Our ability to report objects using only a single detection means that 70\% of the reported SNe occurred within one day after the first detection. ALeRCE has only reported candidates not otherwise detected or selected by other groups, therefore adding new early transients to the bulk of objects available for early follow-up. Our work represents an important milestone toward rapid alert classifications with the next generation of large etendue telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.},

  abstract = {The discovery that axisymmetric dust rings are ubiquitous in protoplanetary disks has provoked a flurry of research on the role of pressure bumps in planet formation. High-resolution simulations by our group have shown that even a modest bump can collect enough dust to trigger planetesimal formation by the streaming instability. In this work, we probe the limits of planetesimal formation when the external source of pressure bump reinforcement is extremely weak. We conduct simulations of radially elongated shearing boxes to capture the entire bump, which is generated and maintained over some timescale \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm reinf\}\$ by a Newtonian relaxation scheme. We find that planetesimal formation is extremely resilient for cm-sized grains. We reduced the strength of reinforcement by up to a factor of 100 and the location and initial masses of planetesimals were essentially unaffected. However, we do find that strong reinforcement causes much faster pebble drift compared to the the standard pebble drift rates. The resulting larger pebble flux enhances the planetesimal growth rate by pebble accretion. We hypothesize that to sustain the bump, our code has to extract angular momentum (the strength of this negative torque depends on \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm reinf\}\$), and some of this torque is transferred to the particles, causing them to drift faster for a stronger torque (i.e., smaller \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm reinf\}\$). Since any physical process that sustains a pressure bump must do so by torquing the gas, we conjecture that the effect on pebble drift is a real phenomenon, motivating further work with physically realistic sources to generate the bump.},

  abstract = {We present evidence that it is unlikely that the streaming instability (SI) can form planetesimals from mm grains inside axisymmetric pressure bumps. We conducted the largest simulation of the SI so far (7 million CPU hours), consisting of a large slice of the disk with mm grains, a solar-like dust-to-gas ratio (\$Z = 0.01\$), and the largest pressure bump that does not cause gravitational instability (GI) in the particle layer. We used a high resolution of \$1000/H\$ to resolve as many unstable modes of the SI as possible. The simulation produced a long-lived particle over-density far exceeding the SI criteria (i.e., a critical solid abundance to headwind parameter ratio \$Z/\textbackslash Pi\$) where past studies predict strong clumping; yet we observed none. The likely reason is that the time it takes particles to cross the high-\$Z/\textbackslash Pi\$ region (\$t\_\{\textbackslash rm cross\}\$) is shorter than the growth timescale of the SI (\$t\_\{\textbackslash rm grow\}\$). We propose an added criterion for planetesimal formation by the SI -- that \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm cross\} {$>$} t\_\{\textbackslash rm grow\}\$. We show that any bump larger than the one in this run would form planetesimals by the GI instead of the SI. Our results significantly restrict the pathways to planet formation: Either protoplanetary disks regularly form grains larger than 1\textasciitilde mm, or planetesimals do not form by the SI in axisymmetric pressure bumps. Since bumps large enough to induce the GI are likely Rossby-wave unstable, we propose that mm grains may only form planetesimals in vortices.},

  abstract = {Large observational surveys, like those that will be conducted at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are expected to discover up to one million new asteroids in the first year of operation. This will more than double the database of known asteroids in a very short time. New methods and techniques will be needed to handle the large influx of data. Here, we tested some of these new methods by studying the population of asteroids on stable orbits inside the \$\{\textbackslash nu\}\_6\$ secular resonance. This resonance is one of the strongest mechanisms for destabilizing the orbits of main-belt bodies and producing Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs). Yet, stable orbital configurations where the asteroid pericenter is either aligned or anti-aligned with that of Saturn exist inside the resonance. The population of stable \$\{\textbackslash nu\}\_6\$ resonators, first discovered in the early 2010s, is now the largest population of asteroids in stable orbits inside a secular resonance. Here we obtained the largest sample of asteroids' proper elements for numbered and multi-opposition objects most likely to be affected by the resonance. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were then used to identify the images of resonant angles of asteroids in stable orbits, more than doubling their number. Clustering methods and the use of machine learning algorithms allowed the identification of the known asteroid families crossed by the \$\{\textbackslash nu\}\_6\$ resonance, the Tina, Euphrosyne, and Svea clusters, and of two entirely new groups: the Tiffanykapler and the 138605 QW177 families.},

It is divided into supervised learning, where the computer is presented with examples of entries, and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs, and unsupervised learning, where no label is provided to the learning algorithm, leaving it alone to find structures. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on artificial neural networks, which are an interconnected group of nodes, inspired by a simplification of neurons in a brain. In asteroid dynamics, machine learning methods have been recently used to identify members of asteroid families, small bodies images in astronomical fields, and to identify resonant arguments images of asteroids in three-body resonances, among other applications. Here we will conduct a full review of available literature in the field, and classify it in terms of metrics recently used by other authors to assess the state of the art of applications of machine learning in other astronomical sub-fields. While applications of machine learning to Solar System bodies, an area that includes imaging and spectrophotometry of small bodies, have already reached a state classified as progressing, with more established research communities and methodologies, and articles where the use of ML lead to discovery of new celestial objects or features, or to new insights in the area, ML applied to asteroid dynamics is still in the emerging phase, with smaller groups, methodologies still not well-established, and fewer papers producing new discoveries or insights. The still pioneering nature of research in the area means that much room of improvement is still available, and that several new enticing scientific discoveries may surge by applications of these new techniques in the next years.},

  abstract = {The asteroidal main belt is crossed by a web of mean-motion and secular resonances, that occur when there is a commensurability between fundamental frequencies of the asteroids and planets. Traditionally, these objects were identified by visual inspection of the time evolution of their resonant argument, which is a combination of orbital elements of the asteroid and the perturbing planet(s). Since the population of asteroids affected by these resonances is, in some cases, of the order of several thousand, this has become a taxing task for a human observer. Recent works used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models to perform such task automatically. In this work, we compare the outcome of such models with those of some of the most advanced and publicly available CNN architectures, like the VGG, Inception and ResNet. The performance of such models is first tested and optimized for overfitting issues, using validation sets and a series of regularization techniques like data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization. The three best-performing models were then used to predict the labels of larger testing databases containing thousands of images. The VGG model, with and without regularizations, proved to be the most efficient method to predict labels of large datasets. Since the Vera C. Rubin observatory is likely to discover up to four million new asteroids in the next few years, the use of these models might become quite valuable to identify populations of resonant minor bodies.},

Recent studies of the water content in early forming planetary systems similar to our own show that water is an abundant and ubiquitous molecule, initially synthesized on the surfaces of tiny interstellar dust grains by the hydrogenation of frozen oxygen. Water then enters a cycle of sublimation/freezing throughout the successive phases of planetary system formation, namely, hot corinos and protoplanetary disks, eventually to be incorporated into planets, asteroids, and comets. The amount of heavy water measured on Earth and in early forming planetary systems suggests that a substantial fraction of terrestrial water was inherited from the very first phases of the Solar System formation and is 4.5 billion years old.},

The algorithm adopted for the inversion of Gaia photometric data assumes, for the sake of simplicity and to minimize CPU execution time, that the objects have triaxial ellipsoid shapes. In the past, this algorithm was tested against large sets of simulated data and small numbers of sparse photometric measurements obtained by HIPPARCOS. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: After the second Gaia data release, it is now possible to test the inversion algorithm against small samples of actual Gaia data for the first time. At the same time, we can attempt a new inversion of older HIPPARCOS measurements, using an updated version of the photometric inversion algorithm. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: The new version of our inversion algorithm includes the treatment of a Lommel-Seeliger scattering relation especially developed for the case of triaxial ellipsoid shapes. In addition, we also performed inversion attempts using a more refined shape model, based on the so-called cellinoid shapes. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: With respect to the old inversion of HIPPARCOS data carried out in the past, we obtain only marginal improvements. In the case of Gaia data, however, we obtain very encouraging results. A successful determination of the rotation period is possible in most cases, in spite of the limited time span covered by data published in the second Gaia data release (GDR2), which makes the determination of the spin axis direction still uncertain. Even a small number of measurements, less than 30 in many cases, are sufficient to obtain a satisfactory inversion solution. Using the more realistic cellinoid shape model, we find further improvement in the determination of the spin period. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: This is a relevant validation of GDR2 photometry of asteroids, and proof of the satisfactory performances of the adopted inversion algorithm.},

We present here new spectra of 22 family members, observed at ESO (European Southern Observatory) and at CASLEO (Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito, Argentina). We find evidence that the family is actually formed by two distinct groupings mutually overlapping in the space of orbital proper elements. The first group of objects, consisting of dark asteroids including several F-type members, can be named after its least-numbered member, 142 Polana. The second group consists of S-type asteroids and should be named after its most plausible least-numbered member, 878 Mildred. Some detailed physical analysis of the two groupings can be already attempted at this stage, including a reasonable reconstruction of the original ejection velocity field for the Mildred family. However, we face here a number of intriguing problems that deserve further analysis. For instance, it is not clear how to interpret the role of the two largest nominal members of the clan, 44 Nysa and 135 Hertha, as well as the presence of several large F-type asteroids apparently not related, but very close to the clan. Moreover, recent discoveries of common spectral features indicating hydrated minerals in the spectra of Nysa and Hertha add complexity to an already puzzling scenario.},

The aim is to constrain aspects of planet formation that have large uncertainties by matching key characteristics of the Solar System. The model produces a good fit to these characteristics for a narrow range of parameter space. Planetary growth beyond the ice line is dominated by pebble accretion. Planetesimal accretion is more important inside the ice line. Pebble accretion inside the ice line is slowed by higher temperatures, partial removal of inflowing pebbles by planetesimal formation and pebble accretion further out in the disk, and increased radial velocities due to gas advection. The terrestrial planets are prevented from accreting much water ice because embryos beyond the ice line reach the pebble isolation mass before the ice line enters the terrestrial-planet region. When only pebble accretion is considered, embryos typically remain near their initial mass or grow to the pebble-isolation mass. Adding planetesimal accretion allows Mars-sized objects to form inside the ice line, and allows giant-planet cores to form over a wider region beyond the ice line. In the region occupied by Mercury, pebble Stokes numbers are small. This delays the formation of embryos and stunts their growth, so that only low-mass planets can form here.},

We classify 282P as a member of the Quasi-Hilda Objects, a group of dynamically unstable objects found in an orbital region similar to, but distinct in their dynamical characteristics to, the Hilda asteroids (objects in 3:2 resonance with Jupiter). Our dynamical simulations show 282P has undergone at least five close encounters with Jupiter and one with Saturn over the last 180 years. 282P was most likely a Centaur or Jupiter Family Comet (JFC) 250 years ago. In 350 years, following some 15 strong Jovian interactions, 282P will most likely migrate to become a JFC or, less likely, a main-belt asteroid. These migrations highlight a dynamical pathway connecting Centaurs and JFC with Quasi-Hildas and, potentially, active asteroids. Synthesizing these results with our thermodynamical modeling and new activity observations, we find volatile sublimation is the primary activity mechanism. Observations of a quiescent 282P, which we anticipate will be possible in 2023, will help confirm our hypothesis by measuring a rotation period and ascertaining spectral type.},

  abstract = {We announce the discovery of a main-belt comet (MBC), 2010 LH15 (alternately designated 2010 TJ175). MBCs are a rare type of main-belt asteroid that display comet-like activity, such as tails or comae, caused by sublimation. Consequently, MBCs help us map the location of solar system volatiles, providing insight into the origins of material prerequisite for life as we know it. However, MBCs have proven elusive, with fewer than 20 found among the 1.1 million known main-belt asteroids. This finding derives from Active Asteroids, a NASA Partner Citizen Science program we designed to identify more of these important objects. After volunteers classified an image of 2010 LH15 as showing activity, we carried out a follow-up investigation which revealed evidence of activity from two epochs spanning nearly a decade. This discovery is timely, with 2010 LH15 inbound towards its 2024 March perihelion passage, with potential activity onset as early as late 2023.},

We discovered evidence of this second activity epoch in an image captured 2016 July 22 with the DECam on the 4 m Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. As of this writing, (248370) 2005 QN173 is just the 8th active asteroid demonstrated to undergo recurrent activity near perihelion. Our analyses demonstrate (248370) 2005 QN173 is likely a member of the active asteroid subset known as main-belt comets, a group of objects that orbit in the main asteroid belt that exhibit activity that is specifically driven by sublimation. We implement an activity detection technique, wedge photometry, that has the potential to detect tails in images of solar system objects and quantify their agreement with computed antisolar and antimotion vectors normally associated with observed tail directions. We present a catalog and an image gallery of archival observations. The object will soon become unobservable as it passes behind the Sun as seen from Earth, and when it again becomes visible (late 2022) it will be farther than 3 au from the Sun. Our findings suggest (248370) 2005 QN173 is most active interior to 2.7 au (0.3 au from perihelion), so we encourage the community to observe and study this special object before 2021 December.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission performed a kinetic impact on asteroid Dimorphos, the satellite of the binary asteroid (65803) Didymos, at 23:14\,UTC on 26 September 2022 as a planetary defence test               1               . DART was the first hypervelocity impact experiment on an asteroid at size and velocity scales relevant to planetary defence, intended to validate kinetic impact as a means of asteroid deflection. Here we report a determination of the momentum transferred to an asteroid by kinetic impact. On the basis of the change in the binary orbit period               2               , we find an instantaneous reduction in Dimorphos's along-track orbital velocity component of 2.70\,{$\pm$}\,0.10\,mm\,s               -1               , indicating enhanced momentum transfer due to recoil from ejecta streams produced by the impact               3,4               . For a Dimorphos bulk density range of 1,500 to 3,300\,kg\,m               -3               , we find that the expected value of the momentum enhancement factor,               {$\beta$}               , ranges between 2.2 and 4.9, depending on the mass of Dimorphos.

These               {$\beta$}               values indicate that substantially more momentum was transferred to Dimorphos from the escaping impact ejecta than was incident with DART. Therefore, the DART kinetic impact was highly effective in deflecting the asteroid Dimorphos.},

Planetesimals themselves are unlikely to form by two-body collisions alone; subkilometer objects have gravitational fields individually too weak, and electrostatic attraction is too feeble for growth beyond a few centimeters. We review the possibility that planetesimals form when self-gravity brings together vast ensembles of small particles. Even when self-gravity is weak, aerodynamic processes can accumulate solids relative to gas, paving the way for gravitational collapse. Particles pile up as they drift radially inward. Gas turbulence stirs particles but can also seed collapse by clumping them. Whereas the feedback of solids on gas triggers vertical-shear instabilities that obstruct self-gravity, this same feedback triggers streaming instabilities that strongly concentrate particles. Numerical simulations find that solids {$\sim$}10\textendash 100 cm in size gravitationally collapse in turbulent disks. We outline areas for progress, including the possibility that still smaller objects self-gravitate.},

We subtract the mean of all maps of a given field, removing static sky signal, and then average the mean-subtracted maps at known asteroid locations.

We place constraints on these asteroids' effective emissivities, brightness temperatures, and light-curve modulation amplitude. Our flux density measurements of (324) Bamberga and (13) Egeria roughly agree with predictions, while our measurements of (22) Kalliope suggest lower flux, corresponding to effective emissivities of 0.64 {$\pm$} 0.11 at 2.0 and {$<$} 0.47 at 3.2 mm. We predict the asteroids detectable in other SPT data sets and find good agreement with detections of (772) Tanete and (1093) Freda in recent data from the SPT-3G camera, which has {$\sim$}10\texttimes{} the mapping speed of SPTpol. This work is the first focused analysis of asteroids in data from CMB surveys, and it demonstrates we can repurpose historic and future data sets for asteroid studies.

Our fragmentation code utilises previous semi-analytic models and follows an implementation method similar to fragmentation for the \$n\$-body code MERCURY. In our \$n\$-body simulations with fragmentation, we decrease the collision and planet formation timescales by inflating the particle radii by an expansion factor \$f\$ and experiment with various values of \$f\$ to understand how expansion factors affect the collision history and final planetary system. As the expansion factor increases, so do the rate of mergers which produces planetary systems with more planets and planets at larger orbits. Additionally, we present a composition tracking code which follows the compositional change of homogeneous bodies as a function of mass exchange and use it to study how fragmentation and the use of an expansion factor affects volatile delivery to the inner terrestrial disc. We find that fragmentation enhances radial mixing relative to perfect merging and that on average, as \$f\$ increases so does the average water mass fraction of the planets. Radial mixing decreases with increasing \$f\$ as collisions happen early on, before the bodies have time to grow to excited orbits and move away from their original location},

  abstract = {One of the main complications for the interpretation of reflectance spectra of airless planetary bodies is surface alteration by space weathering caused by irradiation by solar wind and micrometeoroid particles. We aim to evaluate the damage to the samples from H and laser irradiation and relate it to the observed alteration in the spectra. We used olivine (OL) and pyroxene (OPX) pellets irradiated by 5 keV H ions and individual fs laser pulses and measured their visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) spectra. We observed the pellets with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We studied structural, mineralogical, and chemical modifications in the samples and connected them to changes in the reflectance spectra. In both minerals, H irradiation induces partially amorphous sub-surface layers containing small vesicles. In OL pellets, these vesicles are more tightly packed than in OPX ones. Related spectral change is mainly in the VIS spectral slope. Changes due to laser irradiation are mostly dependent on material's melting temperature. Only the laser-irradiated OL contains nanophase Fe particles, which induce detectable spectral slope change throughout the measured spectral range. Our results suggest that spectral changes at VIS-NIR wavelengths are mainly dependent on thickness of (partially) amorphous sub-surface layers. Amorphisation smooths microroughness, increasing the contribution of volume scattering and absorption over surface scattering. Soon after exposure to the space environment, the appearance of partially amorphous sub-surface layers results in rapid changes in the VIS spectral slope. In later stages (onset of micrometeoroid bombardment), we expect an emergence of nanoparticles to also mildly affect the NIR spectral slope. An increase in dimensions of amorphous layers and vesicles in the more space-weathered material will only cause band-depth variation and darkening.},

  abstract = {The Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) continues to be the most productive Near Earth Object (NEO) survey in operation, accounting for nearly two-thirds of all NEO discoveries since 2005. We present a review of the current status of the survey operations, and highlight recent and future upgrades to our instrumentation. Recently, CSS has refurbished a 1.0-m telescope on Mt. Lemmon, Arizona, adjacent to the 1.5-m survey telescope. This telescope will be primarily used for NEO follow-up, recovery, and physical characterization of NEOs including colors and light curves. It will be capable of remote or robotic operations, programmed by adaptive queue-planning software of our own design. We expect to complete commissioning activities and begin full-time operations by the end of this year. A large-format camera featuring a single 10k x 10k detector is in the process of being fabricated for the 1.5-m survey telescope. The new camera system will increase the field-of-view from 1.2 to 5.0 square degrees, and the nightly coverage rate from 180 to 750 square degrees, to limiting magnitude V 21.5.

  abstract = {In this paper we present a two-step neural network model to separate detections of solar system objects from optical and electronic artifacts in data obtained with the ``Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System'' (ATLAS), a near-Earth asteroid sky survey system. A convolutional neural network is used to classify small ``postage-stamp'' images of candidate detections of astronomical sources into eight classes, followed by a multi-layered perceptron that provides a probability that a temporal sequence of four candidate detections represents a real astronomical source. The goal of this work is to reduce the time delay between Near-Earth Object (NEO) detections and submission to the Minor Planet Center. Due to the rare and hazardous nature of NEOs, a low false negative rate is a priority for the model. We show that the model reaches 99.6\% accuracy on real asteroids in ATLAS data with a 0.4\% false negative rate. Deployment of this model on ATLAS has reduced the amount of NEO candidates that astronomers must screen by 90\%, thereby bringing ATLAS one step closer to full autonomy.},

The impact was also detected by the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) instrument on the GOES-17 satellite and infrasound sensors in Hawaii. The USG measurements reported a steep entry angle of \$67\{\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\}\$ from horizontal from a radiant \$13\{\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\}\$ E of N and an impact speed of 11.7 km/s. Interpretation of all energy yields produces a preferred energy estimate of 0.4 KT TNT, corresponding to a \$23,000\$ kilogram \$3\$ meter diameter meteoroid. A post-impact search of telescopic images found that the ATLAS survey captured the object just 10 minutes prior to impact at an Earth-centred distance of nearly \$11,900\$ kilometers with apparent magnitude \$m\textbackslash text\{=\}12.5\$. The object appears as a \$0.44\{\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\}\$ streak originating on the eastern edge of the image extending one-third of the predicted (based on the CNEOS state vector) \$1.26\{\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\}\$ over the 30 second exposure. The streak shows brightness variability consistent with small asteroid rotation. The position of Earth's shadow, the object's size, and its consistency with the CNEOS state vector confirm the object is likely natural. This is the sixth exoatmospheric detection of an NEA impactor and the closest initial telescopic detection prior to an impact. The high altitude of peak fireball brightness suggest it was a weak object comparable in many respects with 2008 TC3 (Almahatta Sitta meteorite), with an absolute magnitude of \$H=32.5\$ and likely low albedo. Therefore we suggest the NEA as having been a C-complex asteroid.},

While it is still debated whether such a purposeful advertisement would be prudent and wise, we propose that mean-motion resonances between neighboring planets -- with orbital periods that form integer ratios -- could in principle be used to encode simple sequences that one would not expect to form in nature. In this Letter we build four multi-resonant planetary systems and test their long-term orbital stability. The four systems each contain 6 or 7 planets and consist of: (i) consecutive integers from 1 to 6; (ii) prime numbers from 2 to 11; (iii) the Fibonacci sequence from 1 to 13; and (iv) the Lazy Caterer sequence from 1 to 16. We built each system using N-body simulations with artificial migration forces. We evaluated the stability of each system over the full 10 Gyr integration of the Sun's main sequence phase. We then tested the stability of these systems for an additional 10 Gyr, during and after post-main sequence evolution of the central stars (assumed to be Sun-like) to their final, white dwarf phase. The only system that was destabilized was the consecutive integer sequence (system i). The other three sequences therefore represent potential SETI beacons.},

  abstract = {In spite of substantial advancements in simulating planet formation, the planet Mercury's diminutive mass, isolated orbit, and the absence of planets with shorter orbital periods in the solar system continue to befuddle numerical accretion models. Recent studies have shown that, if massive embryos (or even giant planet cores) formed early in the innermost parts of the Sun's gaseous disk, they would have migrated outward. This migration may have reshaped the surface density profile of terrestrial planet-forming material and generated conditions favorable to the formation of Mercury-like planets. Here, we continue to develop this model with an updated suite of numerical simulations. We favor a scenario where Earth and Venus' progenitor nuclei form closer to the Sun and subsequently sculpt the Mercury-forming region by migrating towards their modern orbits. This rapid formation of {$\sim$}0.5 M{$\oplus$} cores at {$\sim$}0.1-0.5 au is consistent with modern high-resolution simulations of planetesimal accretion. In successful realizations, Earth and Venus accrete mostly dry, Enstatite Chondrite-like material as they migrate; thus providing a simple explanation for the masses of all four terrestrial planets, inferred isotopic differences between Earth and Mars, and Mercury's isolated orbit. Furthermore, our models predict that Venus' composition should be similar to the Earth's, and possibly derived from a larger fraction of dry material. Conversely, Mercury analogs in our simulations attain a range of final compositions.},

  abstract = {Advances in computing power and numerical methodologies over the past several decades sparked a prolific output of dynamical investigations of the late stages of terrestrial planet formation. Among other peculiar inner solar system qualities, the ability of simulations to reproduce the small mass of Mars within the planets' geochemically inferred accretion timescale of {$<$}10 Myr after the appearance of calcium aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) is arguably considered the gold standard for judging evolutionary hypotheses. At present, a number of independent models are capable of consistently generating Mars-like planets and simultaneously satisfying various important observational and geochemical constraints. However, all models must still account for the effects of the epoch of giant planet migration and orbital instability; an event which dynamical and cosmochemical constraints indicate occurred within the first 100 Myr after nebular gas dispersal. If the instability occurred in the first few Myr of this window, the disturbance might have affected the bulk of Mars' growth. In this manuscript, we turn our attention to a scenario where the instability took place after t=50 Myr. Specifically, we simulate the instability's effects on three nearly-assembled terrestrial systems that were generated via previous embryo accretion models and contain three large proto-planets with orbits interior to a collection of \textasciitilde Mars-mass embryos and debris. While the instability consistently triggers a Moon-forming impact and efficiently removes excessive material from the Mars-region in our models, we find that our final systems are too dynamically excited and devoid of Mars and Mercury analogs. Thus, we conclude that, while possible, our scenario is far more improbable than one where the instability either occurred earlier, or at a time where Earth and Venus' orbits were far less dynamically excited.},

With the gas, we cover the various taxonomic studies that have broken comets into groups and compare what is seen at all wavelengths. We also discuss what has been learned from mass spectrometers during flybys. A few caveats for our interpretation are discussed. With dust, much of our information comes from flybys. They include in situ analyses as well as samples returned to Earth for laboratory measurements. Remote sensing IR observations and polarimetry are also discussed. For both gas and dust, we discuss what instruments the Rosetta spacecraft and Philae lander will bring to bear to improve our understanding of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as ``ground-truth'' for our previous comprehensive studies.

The photometric and long-slit CCD data described in this paper were obtained specifically for this project, while the IUE data are archival. The underlying parameter space was examined and our knowledge of such factors as the outflow and ejection velocities is discussed. We conclude that it is difficult to constrain the lifetime of OH but that the H2O lifetimes must be dependent on changes in the solar UV flux. Our data are consistent with the expectation that as the solar activity, and thus UV flux, increases, the H2O lifetimes decrease. From our data, we show that the combined theoretical lifetimes for H2O and OH do not produce good fits to the data; thus, at least one set of theoretical lifetimes must be in error. Our data require shorter H2O lifetimes and/or shorter OH lifetimes. We present some useful relations for determining which lifetimes and velocities to use for future applications. Additionally, we have derived improved lifetimes and scale lengths for use computing production rates with simple models. The new parent lifetimes and scale lengths are about 15-45\% shorter than commonly used values which ignore effects due to solar activity. Finally, we discuss what data types are needed in the future to enable better modeling of cometary data.},

For the remaining 110 comets, some emission from CN, OH, NH, C3, C2, CH, and NH2 molecules were observed on at least one occasion. We converted the observed molecular column densities to production rates using a Haser (Haser, L. [1957]. Liege Inst. Astrophysics Reprint No. 394) model. We defined a restricted data set of comets that had at least three nights of observations. The restricted data set consists of 59 comets. We used ratios of production rates to study the trends in the data. We find two classes of comets: typical and carbon-chain depleted comets. Using a very strict definition of depleted comets, requiring C2 and C3 to both be depleted, we find 9\% of our restricted data set comets to be depleted. Using a more relaxed definition that requires only C2 to be below a threshold (similar to other researchers), we find 25\% of the comets are depleted. Two-thirds of the depleted comets are Jupiter Family comets, while one-third are Long Period comets. 37\% of the Jupiter Family comets are depleted, while 18.5\% of the Long Period comets are depleted.

The purpose of this work is to obtain a catalogue of phase function parameters (H and G) for all the asteroids that were observed during the Gaia mission and that were published in DR2. For this purpose, we introduce an algorithm capable of building this catalogue from the magnitude and UTC epoch data present in the DR2 data base. Because Gaia will never observe asteroids with a phase angle of 0{$\smwhtcircle$} (corresponding to opposition), but with phase angles higher than 10{$\smwhtcircle$}, we added data from ground observations (corresponding to small phase angles) and thus improved the determination of the H and G parameters of the phase function. We also built a catalogue of the parameters of the H, G1 and G2 phase function. We compared our results of the H, G functions with those of the Astorb data base and observed that the level of agreement is satisfactory.},

One example of such a survey is the Sloan Moving Object Catalog (MOC), which lists the astrometric and photometric information of all moving objects captured by the Sloan field of view. One great advantage of this telescope is represented by its set of five filters, allowing for taxonomic analysis of asteroids by studying their colors. However, until now, the color variation produced by the change of phase angle of the object has not been taken into account. In this paper, we address this issue by using absolute magnitudes for classification. We aim to produce a new taxonomic classification of asteroids based on their magnitudes that is unaffected by variations caused by the change in phase angle. We selected 9481 asteroids with absolute magnitudes of Hg, Hi and Hz, computed from the Sloan Moving Objects Catalog using the HG12 system. We calculated the absolute colors with them. To perform the taxonomic classification, we applied a unsupervised machine learning algorithm known as fuzzy C-means. This is a useful soft clustering tool for working with \{data sets where the different groups are not completely separated and there are regions of overlap between them. We have chosen to work with the four main taxonomic complexes, C, S, X, and V, as they comprise most of the known spectral characteristics. We classified a total of 6329 asteroids with more than 60\% probability of belonging to the assigned taxonomic class, with 162 of these objects having been characterized by an ambiguous classification in the past. By analyzing the sample obtained in the plane Semimajor axis versus inclination, we identified 15 new V-type asteroid candidates outside the Vesta family region.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {The Jupiter Trojans are a large group of asteroids that are co-orbiting with Jupiter near its L4 and L5 Lagrange points. The study of Jupiter Trojans is crucial for testing different models of planet formation that are directly related to our understanding of solar system evolution. In this work, we select known Jupiter Trojans listed by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) from the full six years dataset (Y6) of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to analyze their photometric properties. The DES data allow us to study Jupiter Trojans with a fainter magnitude limit than previous studies in a homogeneous survey with \$griz\$ band measurements. We extract a final catalog of 573 unique Jupiter Trojans. Our sample include 547 asteroids belonging to L5. This is one of the largest analyzed samples for this group. By comparing with the data reported by other surveys we found that the color distribution of L5 Trojans is similar to that of L4 Trojans. We find that L5 Trojans' \$g - i\$ and \$g - r\$ colors become less red with fainter absolute magnitudes, a trend also seen in L4 Trojans. Both the L4 and L5 clouds consistently show such a color-size correlation over an absolute magnitude range \$11 {$<$} H {$<$} 18\$. We also use DES colors to perform taxonomic classifications. C and P-type asteroids outnumber D-type asteroids in the L5 Trojans DES sample, which have diameters in the 5 - 20 km range. This is consistent with the color-size correlation.},

This has enabled the calculation of exponential power-law variations with heliocentric distance of these comets both before and after perihelion, as well as the absolute values of the water production rates. These various measures of overall water activity including pre- and post-perihelion exponents, absolute water production rates at 1 AU, active surface areas and their variations have been compared with a number of dynamical quantities for each comet including dynamical class, original semi-major axis, nucleus radius (when available), and compositional taxonomic class.

However, the majority of cometary gases observed at radio wavelengths have yet to be mapped, so their production/release mechanisms remain uncertain. Here we present observations of six molecular species towards comet 46P/Wirtanen, obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) during the comet's unusually close (\textasciitilde 0.1 au) approach to Earth in December 2018. Interferometric maps of HCN, CH3OH, CH3CN, H2CO, CS and HNC were obtained at an unprecedented sky-projected spatial resolution of up to 25 km, enabling the nucleus and coma sources of these molecules to be accurately quantified. The HCN, CH3OH and CH3CN spatial distributions are consistent with production by direct outgassing from (or very near to) the nucleus, with a significant proportion of the observed CH3OH originating from sublimation of icy grains in the near-nucleus coma (at a scale-length \$L\_p=36\textbackslash pm7\$ km). On the other hand, H2CO, CS and HNC originate primarily from distributed coma sources (with \$L\_p\$ values in the range 550-16,000 km), the identities of which remain to be established. The HCN, CH3OH and HNC abundances in 46P are consistent with the average values previously observed in comets, whereas the H2CO, CH3CN and CS abundances are relatively low.},

Data Release 1 contains 23\,903 reduced and astrometrically calibrated images taken from 2008 March to 2019 July with a median of the mean uncertainties in the astrometric calibration of 0.04\,arcsec. The catalogue associated to 6132 images in the Sloan griz filters provides accurate astrometry and PSF calibrated photometry for 139\,337 point-like detections corresponding to 21\,985 different sources extracted from a selection of 2338 good-quality images. The mean internal astrometric and photometric accuracies are 0.05\,arcsec and 0.04\,mag, respectively. In this work we describe the approach followed to process and calibrate the images, and the construction of the associated catalogue, together with the validation quality tests carried out. Finally, we present three cases to prove the science capabilities of the catalogue: discovery and identification of asteroids, identification of potential transients, and identification of cool and ultracool dwarfs.},

  abstract = {Asteroids are an indelible part of most astronomical surveys though only a few surveys are dedicated to their detection. Over the years, high cadence microlensing surveys have amassed several terabytes of data while scanning primarily the Galactic Bulge and Magellanic Clouds for microlensing events and thus provide a treasure trove of opportunities for scientific data mining. In particular, numerous asteroids have been observed by visual inspection of selected images. This paper presents novel deep learning-based solutions for the recovery and discovery of asteroids in the microlensing data gathered by the MOA project. Asteroid tracklets can be clearly seen by combining all the observations on a given night and these tracklets inform the structure of the dataset. Known asteroids were identified within these composite images and used for creating the labelled datasets required for supervised learning. Several custom CNN models were developed to identify images with asteroid tracklets. Model ensembling was then employed to reduce the variance in the predictions as well as to improve the generalisation error, achieving a recall of 97.67\%. Furthermore, the YOLOv4 object detector was trained to localize asteroid tracklets, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 90.97\%. These trained networks will be applied to 16 years of MOA archival data to find both known and unknown asteroids that have been observed by the survey over the years. The methodologies developed can be adapted for use by other surveys for asteroid recovery and discovery.},

Here we use the OSSOS Survey Simulator to measure their intrinsic orbital distributions using an empirical parameterized model. Because many of the resonances had only one or very few detections, \$j\$:\$k\$ resonant objects were grouped by \$k\$ in order to have a better basis for comparison between models and reality. We also use the Survey Simulator to constrain their absolute populations, finding that they are much larger than predicted by any published Neptune migration model to date; we also find population ratios that are inconsistent with published models, presenting a challenge for future Kuiper Belt emplacement models. The estimated population ratios between these resonances are largely consistent with scattering-sticking predictions, though further discoveries of resonant TNOs with high-precision orbits will be needed to determine whether scattering-sticking can explain the entire distant resonant population or not.},

Among them, 6 molecules were detected for the first time (Bockele\textasciiacute e-Morvan et al. 2000) in the course of a spectral survey conducted at radio wavelengths in comet Hale-Bopp with the CSO, the IRAM 30-m telescope and Plateau de Bure interferometer. In addition, many species were searched for unsuccessfully, some of them with stringent upper limits. We present here a review of these observations and further analysis of their results. This include: (i) confirmed detection of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO); (ii) limits on small molecules such as ketene (H2CCO) or methanimine (CH2NH); (iii) limits on the abundance ratios in homologous series such as HC5N/HC3N, ethanol/methanol, acetic acid/formic acid; (iv) searches for precursors of key cometary species such as atomic Na and HNC; (v) constraints on more exotic species ranging from water dimer (H2O)2 to glycine; (vi) detection of the H324S isotopic species and independent observations of HDO and DCN; (vii) limits on several other deuterated species; (viii) limits on several radicals and ions and a tentative detection of the C2H radical; (ix) the presence of unidentified lines. Typical abundance upper limits of 2\textendash 5 \texttimes 10-4 relative to water are achieved for many species. Better upper limits are obtained for some linear molecules with high dipole moments. But more complex molecules such as dimethyl ether or glycine are poorly constrained. These results should give important clues to the chemical composition of cometary ices, to the formation mechanisms of cometary material, and to the chemical processes which occur in the inner coma.},

  abstract = {Most close-in planetary satellites are in synchronous rotation, which is usually the stable end-point of tidal despinning. Saturn's moon Hyperion is a notable exception by having a chaotic rotation. Hyperion's dynamical state is a consequence of its high eccentricity and its highly prolate shape (Wisdom et al. 1984). As many binary asteroids also have elongated secondaries, chaotic rotation is expected for moons in eccentric binaries (C\textasciiacute{} uk \& Nesvorny\textasciiacute{} 2010), and a minority of asteroidal secondaries may be in that state (Pravec et al. 2016). The question of secondary rotation is also important for the action of the BYORP effect, which can quickly evolve orbits of synchronous (but not non-synchronous) secondaries (C\textasciiacute{} uk \& Burns 2005). Here we report results of a large set of short numerical simulations which indicate that, apart from synchronous and classic chaotic rotation, close-in irregularly-shaped asteroidal secondaries can occupy an additional, intermediate rotational state. In this ``barrel instability'' the secondary slowly rolls along its long axis, while the longest axis is staying largely aligned with the primary-secondary line. This behavior may be more difficult to detect through lightcurves than a fully chaotic rotation, but would likewise shut down BYORP. We show that the binary's eccentricity, separation measured in secondary's radii and the secondary's shape are all important for determining whether the system settles in synchronous rotation, chaotic tumbling, or barrel instability. We compare our results for synthetic asteroids with known binary pairs to determine which of these behaviors may be present in the Near-Earth Asteroid binary population.},

Studies of the orbital history of Saturn's moons usually assume that their past dynamics was also dominated solely by two-body resonances. Using direct numerical integrations, we find that three-body resonances among Saturnian satellites were quite common in the past, and could result in a relatively long-term, but finite capture time (10 Myr or longer). We find that these three-body resonances are invariably of the eccentricity type, and do not appear to affect the moons' inclinations. While some three-body resonances are located close to two-body resonances (but involve the orbital precession of the third body), others are isolated, with no two-body arguments being near resonance. We conclude that future studies of the system's past must take full account of three-body resonances, which have been overlooked in the past work.},

Several approaches have been proposed to potentially prevent an asteroid impact with Earth by deflecting or disrupting an asteroid               1\textendash 3               . A test of kinetic impact technology was identified as the highest-priority space mission related to asteroid mitigation               1               . NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission is a full-scale test of kinetic impact technology. The mission's target asteroid was Dimorphos, the secondary member of the S-type binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos. This binary asteroid system was chosen to enable ground-based telescopes to quantify the asteroid deflection caused by the impact of~the DART spacecraft               4               . Although past missions have utilized impactors to investigate the properties of small bodies               5,6               , those earlier missions were not intended to deflect their targets and did not achieve measurable deflections. Here we report the DART spacecraft's autonomous kinetic impact into Dimorphos and reconstruct the impact event, including the timeline leading to impact, the location and nature of the DART impact site, and the size and shape of Dimorphos. The successful impact of the DART spacecraft with Dimorphos and the resulting change in the orbit of Dimorphos               7               demonstrates that kinetic impactor technology is a viable technique to potentially defend Earth if necessary.},

  abstract = {We present the results of BVRIZ photometry of 56 near-Earth objects (NEOs) obtained with the 1-m Jacobus Kapteyn telescope on La Palma during 2000 and 2001. Our sample includes many NEOs with particularly deep 1-␮m pyroxene/olivine absorption bands, similar to Q-type asteroids. We also classify three NEOs with particularly blue colors. No D-type asteroids were found, placing an upper limit of ϳ2\% on the fraction of the NEO population originating in the outer main belt or the Trojan clouds. The ratio of dark to bright objects in our sample was found to be 0.40, significantly higher than current theoretical predictions. As well as classifying the NEOs, we have investigated color trends with size and orbit. We see a general trend for larger silicate objects to have shallower absorption bands but find no significant difference in the distribution of taxonomic classes at small and large sizes. Our data clearly show that different taxonomic classes tend to occupy different regions of (a, e) space. By comparing our data with current model predictions for NEO dynamical evolution we see that Q-, R-, and V-type NEOs tend to have orbits associated with ``fast track'' delivery from the main belt, whereas S-type NEOs tend to have orbits associated with ``slow track'' delivery. This outcome would be expected if space weathering occurs on time scales of Ͼ106 years. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

Taking a cue from the \$N00N\$ state nomenclature, we call these types of states \$LOOL\$ (L00L) or \$p00p\$-entangled. They are generated by shifting one photon in the LG mode space and combining it with a second (initially uncorrelated) photon at a beamsplitter, followed by coincidence detection. In order to verify two-photon coherence, we demonstrate a two-photon ``twisted'' quantum eraser, where Hong-Ou-Mandel interference is recovered between two distinguishable photons by projecting them into a rotated LG superposition basis. Using an entanglement witness, we find that our generated \$LOOL\$ and \$p00p\$ states have fidelities of 95.31\textbackslash\% and 89.80\textbackslash\% to their respective ideal maximally entangled states. Besides being of fundamental interest, this type of entanglement will likely have a significant impact on tickling the average quantum physicist's funny bone.},

  abstract = {Methods. We used observations of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the ESA Rosetta spacecraft, particularly by the OSIRIS camera system, combined with data from the NASA Stardust sample-return mission to comet 81P/Wild 2 and from meteoritics; we also used existing observations from ground or from spacecraft of irregular satellites of the giant planets, Centaurs, and TNOs. We performed modeling of thermophysics, hydrostatics, orbit evolution, and collision physics. Results. We find that thermal processing due to short-lived radionuclides, combined with collisional processing during accretion in the primordial disk, creates a population of medium-sized bodies that are comparably dense, compacted, strong, heavily depleted in supervolatiles like CO and CO2; they contain little to no amorphous water ice, and have experienced extensive metasomatism and aqueous alteration due to liquid water. Irregular satellites Phoebe and Himalia are potential representatives of this population. Collisional rubble piles inherit these properties from their parents. Contrarily, comet nuclei have low density, high porosity, weak strength, are rich in supervolatiles, may contain amorphous water ice, and do not display convincing evidence of in situ metasomatism or aqueous alteration. We outline a comet formation scenario that starts in the solar nebula and ends in the primordial disk, that reproduces these observed properties, and additionally explains the presence of extensive layering on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (and on 9P/Tempel 1 observed by Deep Impact), its bi-lobed shape, the extremely slow growth of comet nuclei as evidenced by recent radiometric dating, and the low collision probability that allows primordial nuclei to survive the age of the solar system. Conclusions. We conclude that observed comet nuclei are primordial rubble piles, and not collisional rubble piles. We argue that TNOs formed as a result of streaming instabilities at sizes below {$\sim$}400 km and that {$\sim$}350 of these grew slowly in a low-mass primordial disk to the size of Triton, Pluto, and Eris, causing little viscous stirring during growth. We thus propose a dynamically cold primordial disk, which prevented mediumsized TNOs from breaking into collisional rubble piles and allowed the survival of primordial rubble-pile comets. We argue that comets formed by hierarchical agglomeration out of material that remained after TNO formation, and that this slow growth was a necessity to avoid thermal processing by short-lived radionuclides that would lead to loss of supervolatiles, and that allowed comet nuclei to incorporate {$\sim$}3 Myr old material from the inner solar system.},

  abstract = {The Primordial Disk of small icy planetesimals, once located at 15-30 AU from the Sun, was disrupted by giant planet migration in the early Solar System. The Primordial Disk thereby became the source region of objects in the current-day Kuiper Belt, Scattered Disk, and Oort Cloud. I present the thermophysics code "Numerical Icy Minor Body evolUtion Simulator", or NIMBUS, and use it to study the thermophysical evolution of planetesimals in the Primordial Disk prior to its disruption. Such modelling is mandatory in order to understand the behaviour of dynamically new comets from the Oort Cloud, as well as the activity of Centaurs and short-period comets from the Scattered Disk, that return pre-processed to the vicinity of the Sun. I find that bodies in the midst of the Primordial Disk with diameters ranging 4-200 km lost all their CO ice on time-scales of order 0.1-10 Myr depending on size, through a combination of protosolar and long-lived radionuclide heating. CO and other hypervolatiles therefore require a less volatile host for their storage. I consider two possible hosts: amorphous water ice and CO2 ice. Because of the high luminosity of the protosun, some Primordial Disk bodies may have sustained significant crystallisation, CO:CO2 segregation, and CO2 sublimation in the uppermost few tens of meters. I discuss how this may affect coma abundance ratios and distant activity in dynamically new comets.},

  abstract = {Neptune's dynamical history shaped the current orbits of Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), leaving clues to the planet's orbital evolution. In the ``classical'' region, a population of dynamically ``hot'' high-inclination KBOs overlies a flat ``cold'' population with distinct physical properties. Simulations of qualitatively different histories for Neptune, including smooth migration on a circular orbit or scattering by other planets to a high eccentricity, have not simultaneously produced both populations. We explore a general Kuiper Belt assembly model that forms hot classical KBOs interior to Neptune and delivers them to the classical region, where the cold population forms in situ. First, we present evidence that the cold population is confined to eccentricities well below the limit dictated by long-term survival. Therefore, Neptune must deliver hot KBOs into the long-term survival region without excessively exciting the eccentricities of the cold population. Imposing this constraint, we explore the parameter space of Neptune's eccentricity and eccentricity damping, migration, and apsidal precession. We rule out much of parameter space, except where Neptune is scattered to a moderately eccentric orbit (e {$>$} 0.15) and subsequently migrates a distance {$\Delta$}aN = 1\textendash 6 AU. Neptune's moderate eccentricity must either damp quickly or be accompanied by fast apsidal precession. We find that Neptune's high eccentricity alone does not generate a chaotic sea in the classical region. Chaos can result from Neptune's interactions with Uranus, exciting the cold KBOs and placing additional constraints. Finally, we discuss how to interpret our constraints in the context of the full, complex dynamical history of the solar system.},

The orbits of the planets, which we studied through numerical integrations of initial conditions that are consistent with observations of the system, are chaotic with a Lyapunov time of only {$\sim$}10 years. The chaos is a consequence of a particular set of orbital resonances, with the inner planet orbiting 34 times for every 29 orbits of the outer planet. The rapidity of the chaos is due to the interaction of the 29:34 resonance with the nearby first-order 6:7 resonance, in contrast to the usual case in which secular terms in the Hamiltonian play a dominant role. Only one contiguous region of phase space, accounting for {$\sim$}4.5\% of the sample of initial conditions studied, corresponds to planetary orbits that do not show large-scale orbital instabilities on the timescale of our integrations ({$\sim$}200 million years). Restricting the orbits to this long-lived region allows a refinement of estimates of the masses and radii of the planets. We find that the long-lived region consists of the initial conditions that satisfy the Hill stability criterion by the largest margin. Any successful theory for the formation of this system will need to account for why its current state is so close to unstable regions of phase space.},

Nevertheless, contemporary Chinese scholars and navigators, to some extent aided by experienced Arab navigators and astronomers, developed independent means of longitude determination both on land and at sea, using a combination of astronomical observations and timekeeping devices that continued to operate adequately on pitching and rolling ships. Despite confusing and speculative accounts in the current literature and sometimes overt nationalistic rhetoric, Chinese technical capabilities applied to longitude determination at sea, while different in design from European advances owing to cultural and societal circumstances, were at least on a par with those of their European counterparts.},

As nearly all simulations to date consider perfect merging (100\% energy dissipation) during embryo\textendash embryo collisions, and typically end up with an overexcited final terrestrial planetary system, it has been suggested that a better treatment of energy dissipation during large collisions could decrease the final dynamical excitation (or AMD). Although some work related to energy dissipation has been done (mostly during the runaway growth phase when planetesimals grow into protoplanets), this had never been fully tested in the post-runaway phase, where protoplanets (embryos) grow chaotically into planets via large collisions among themselves. In this work, we test varying amounts of energy dissipation within embryo\textendash embryo collisions, by assuming a given coefficient of restitution for collisions. Our results show that varying the level of energy dissipated within embryo\textendash embryo collisions do not play any important role in the final terrestrial planetary system. We have found a strong linear correlation in our results related to the final number of planets formed and the final AMD. Additionally, reproducing the current radial mass concentration of the terrestrial planets, even when starting from an annulus of material, is challenging when modeling growth from planetesimals to planets.},

  abstract = {High-resolution infrared spectra of Jupiter-family comet 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdu\v{s}\'akov\'a were obtained with NIRSPEC at the W. M. Keck Observatory on two postperihelion dates (UT 2017 February 13 and 19), when the comet was at heliocentric distances of 1.01 and 1.10 AU, respectively. On UT February 13, H2O was measured simultaneously with six trace parent molecules: CH3OH, C2H6, HCN, NH3, C2H2, and H2CO. On UT February 19, CH4 and CO were also targeted in addition to the species measured on UT February 13. Abundances of CO, CH4, and C2H2 relative to H2O are consistent with values obtained from IRTF/iSHELL observations of 45P in early January 2017 just after perihelion when the heliocentric distance was 0.55\textendash 0.56 AU. Differences are seen in H2CO/H2O, C2H6/H2O, CH3OH/H2O, and HCN/H2O in February compared to January. Additionally, NH3 abundances appear highly variable during the February measurements, suggesting possible fluctuations of a factor of ten; however, there is significant uncertainty in quantifying NH3 owing to the marginal detections of only one or two lines on each of the two dates. Combining all infrared spectroscopic observations of 45P in January and February 2017, a post-perihelion relationship of Q(H2O) = (2.81 {$\pm$} 0.25) \texttimes{} 1027 [Rh(-3.83 {$\pm$} 0.18)] molecules s-1 is derived. However, all measurements suggest significant variability in H2O production on timescales of hours and days. Compared to other comets, volatile abundances relative to H2O in 45P are as follows: CO (depleted relative to all measured comets), CH3OH (enriched/all comets), CH4 and C2H6 (typical/all comets, enriched/Jupiter-family comets), C2H2 (depleted/all comets, typical/Jupiter-family comets), H2CO (January: typical, February depleted/all comets), HCN (January: severely depleted, February: typical/Jupiter-family comets). The small geocentric distances of the comet in February 2017 provide high spatial resolution in the coma of 45P (\textasciitilde 12 and 19 km/pixel on February 13 and 19, respectively). Overall, the spatial distributions of volatiles and dust suggest a relatively symmetric and uniform coma during the UT February 13 and 19 observations, with small spatial differences noted between some volatile species. Measured C2H2 and HCN abundances are consistent with HCN as the primary parent of CN and C2H2 as a significant but not primary parent for C2, based on C2 and CN production rate measurements from the 2017 and previous apparitions. Extracted spectra show an increase in the dust-to-gas ratio in 45P from February 13 to 19 in agreement with contemporaneous narrowband optical measurements.},

  abstract = {Because the lifespan of near-Earth objects (NEOs) is shorter than the age of the Solar System, these objects originate elsewhere. Their most likely sources are the main asteroid belt and comets. Through physical observations we seek to identify potential dormant or extinct comets among ``asteroids'' catalogued as NEOs and thereby determine the fraction of ``comet candidates'' within the total NEO population. Both discovery statistics and dynamical models indicate that candidate cometary objects in near-Earth space are predominantly found among those having a jovian Tisserand parameter Tj {$<$} 3. Therefore, we seek to identify comet candidates among asteroid-like NEOs using three criteria: Tj {$<$} 3, spectral parameters (C, D, T, or P taxonomic types), and/or low ({$<$}0.075) albedos. We present new observations for 20 NEOs having Tj {$<$} 3, consisting of visible spectra, near-infrared spectra, and/or albedo measurements obtained using the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, the Kitt Peak National Observatory 4 m, and the Magellan Observatory 6.5-m. Four of our ``asteroid'' targets have been subsequently confirmed as low activity comets. Thus our sample includes spectra of the nuclei of Comets 2002 EX12 = 169P (NEAT), 2001 WF2 = 182P (LONEOS), 2003 WY25 = D/1891 W1 (Blanplain), and Halley Family Comet 2006 HR30 = P/2006 HR30 (Siding Spring). From the available literature, we tabulate physical properties for 55 NEOs having Tj {$<$} 3, and after accounting for possible bias effects, we estimate that 54 {$\pm$} 10\% of NEOs in Tj {$<$} 3 orbits have ``comet-like'' spectra or albedos. Bias corrected discovery statistics [Stuart, J.S., Binzel, R.P., 2004. Icarus 170, 295\textendash 311] estimate 30 {$\pm$} 5\% of the entire NEO population resides in orbits having Tj {$<$} 3. Combining these two factors suggests that 16 {$\pm$} 5\% of the total discovered ``asteroid-like'' NEO population has ``comet-like'' dynamical and physical properties. Outer main-belt asteroids typically have similar taxonomic and albedo properties as our ``comet candidates.'' Using the model of Bottke et al. [Bottke, W.F., Morbidelli, A., Jedicke, R., Petit, J.M., Levison, H., Michel, P., Metcalfe, T.S., 2002. Icarus 156, 399\textendash 433] to evaluate source region probabilities, we conclude that 8 {$\pm$} 5\% of the total asteroid-like NEO population have the requisite orbital properties, physical properties, and dynamical likelihood to have originated as comets from the outer Solar System.},

We identify spectral matches between 500 asteroid spectra and over 1,000 samples of RELAB meteorite spectra over 0.45-2.5 microns. We reproduce many major and previously known meteorite-asteroid connections and find possible new, more rare or less-established connections. Well-established connections include: ordinary chondrites (OC) with S-complex asteroids; pristine CM carbonaceous chondrites with Ch-type asteroids and heated CMs with C-type asteroids; HED meteorites with V-types; enstatite chondrites with Xc-type asteroids; CV meteorites with K-type asteroids; Brachinites, Pallasites and R chondrites with olivine-dominated A-type asteroids. We find a trend from Q, Sq, S, Sr to Sv correlates with LL to H, with Q-types matching predominately to L and LL ordinary chondrites, and Sr and Sv matching predominantly with L and H ordinary chondrites. Ordinary chondrite samples that match to the X-complex, all measurements of slabs and many labeled as dark or black (shocked) OCs. We find carbonaceous chondrite samples having spectral slopes large enough to match D-type asteroid spectra. In many cases the asteroid type to meteorite type links are not unique. While there are well established matches between an asteroid class and meteorite class, there are less common but still spectrally compatible matches between many asteroid types and meteorite types. This result emphasizes the diversity of asteroid and meteorite compositions and highlights the degeneracy of classification by spectral features alone. Recent and upcoming spacecraft missions will shed light on the compositions of many of the asteroid classes, particularly those without diagnostic features, (C-, B-, X-, and D-types), with measurements of Ceres, Ryugu, Bennu, Psyche, and C-, P-, and D-types as part of the Lucy mission.},

  abstract = {Evidence is seen for young, fresh surfaces among Near-Earth and Main-Belt asteroids even though space-weathering timescales are shorter than the age of the surfaces. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to refresh asteroid surfaces on short timescales, such as planetary encounters, YORP spinup, thermal degradation, and collisions. Additionally, other factors such as grain size effects have been proposed to explain the existence of these "fresh-looking" spectra. To investigate the role each of these mechanisms may play, we collected a sample of visible and near-infrared spectra of 477 near-Earth and Mars Crosser asteroids with similar sizes and compositions - all with absolute magnitude H {$>$} 16 and within the S-complex and having olivine to pyroxene (ol/(ol+opx)) ratios {$>$} 0.65. We taxonomically classify these objects in the Q (fresh) and S (weathered) classes. We find four trends in the Q/S ratio: 1) previous work demonstrated the Q/S ratio increases at smaller sizes down to H{$<$}16, but we find a sharp increase near H=19 after which the ratio decreases monotonically 2) in agreement with many previous studies, the Q/S ratio increases with decreasing perihelion distance, and we find it is non-zero for larger perihelia greater than 1.2AU, 3) as a new finding our work reveals the Q/S ratio has a sharp, significant peak near 5 degrees orbital inclination, and 4) we confirm previous findings that the Q/S ratio is higher for objects that have the possibility of encounter with Earth and Venus versus those that don't, however this finding cannot be distinguished from the perihelion trend. No single resurfacing mechanism can explain all of these trends, so multiple mechanisms are required. It is likely that a combination of all four resurfacing mechanisms are needed to account for all observational trends.},

  abstract = {The distribution of asteroids across the main belt has been studied for decades to understand the current compositional distribution and what that tells us about the formation and evolution of our Solar System. All-sky surveys now provide orders of magnitude more data than targeted surveys. We present a method to bias-correct the asteroid population observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) according to size, distance, and albedo. We taxonomically classify this dataset consistent with the Bus and Binzel (Bus, S.J., Binzel, R.P. [2002]. Icarus 158, 146\textendash 177) and Bus\textendash DeMeo et al. (DeMeo, F.E., Binzel, R.P., Slivan, S.M., Bus, S.J. [2009]. Icarus 202(July), 160\textendash 180) systems and present the resulting taxonomic distribution. The dataset includes asteroids as small as 5 km, a factor of three in diameter smaller than in previous work such as by Moth\'e-Diniz et al. (Moth\'e-Diniz, T., Carvano, J.M.\'A., Lazzaro, D. [2003]. Icarus 162(March), 10\textendash 21). Because of the wide range of sizes in our sample, we present the distribution by number, surface area, volume, and mass whereas previous work was exclusively by number. While the distribution by number is a useful quantity and has been used for decades, these additional quantities provide new insights into the distribution of total material. We find evidence for D-types in the inner main belt where they are unexpected according to dynamical models of implantation of bodies from the outer Solar System into the inner Solar System during planetary migration (Levison, H.F., Bottke, W.F., Gounelle, M., Morbidelli, A., Nesvorny\textasciiacute{} , D., Tsiganis, K. [2009]. Nature 460(July), 364\textendash 366). We find no evidence of Stypes or other unexpected classes among Trojans and Hildas, albeit a bias favoring such a detection. Finally, we estimate for the first time the total amount of material of each class in the inner Solar System. The main belt's most massive classes are C, B, P, V and S in decreasing order. Excluding the four most massive asteroids, (1) Ceres, (2) Pallas, (4) Vesta and (10) Hygiea that heavily skew the values, primitive material (C-, P-types) account for more than half main-belt and Trojan asteroids by mass, most of the remaining mass being in the S-types. All the other classes are minor contributors to the material between Mars and Jupiter.},

MOPS achieves {$>$}99:5\% efficiency in producing orbits from a synthetic but realistic population of asteroids whose measurements were simulated for a Pan-STARRS4-class telescope. Additionally, using a nonphysical grid population, we demonstrate that MOPS can detect populations of currently unknown objects such as interstellar asteroids. MOPS has been adapted successfully to the prototype Pan-STARRS1 telescope despite differences in expected false detection rates, fill-factor loss, and relatively sparse observing cadence compared to a hypothetical Pan-STARRS4 telescope and survey. MOPS remains highly efficient at detecting objects but drops to 80\% efficiency at producing orbits. This loss is primarily due to configurable MOPS processing limits that are not yet tuned for the Pan-STARRS1 mission. The core MOPS software package is the product of more than 15 person-years of software development and incorporates countless additional years of effort in third-party software to perform lower-level functions such as spatial searching or orbit determination. We describe the high-level design of MOPS and essential subcomponents, the suitability of MOPS for other survey programs, and suggest a road map for future MOPS development.},

We model the early dynamical evolution of the outer Solar System to study possible dynamical mechanisms to implant a Ceres-sized planetesimal in the asteroid belt from the trans-Saturnian region. We calculate that the fraction of the population of Ceres-sized planetesimals that are captured in the asteroid belt is in the range of 2.8e-5 to 1.2e-3 depending on the initial location in the outer planetesimal disk. The captured bodies have a 70\% probability to have a semimajor axis between 2.5 and 3 au, a 33\% probability to have an eccentricity smaller than 0.2 and a 45\% probability to have an orbital inclination smaller than 10 degrees. Assuming the existence of 3,600 Ceres-size planetesimals in the inner part of the trans-Saturnian disk, consistent with the estimate of Nesvorny \& Vokrouhlicky (2016) for the trans-Neptunian disk, our estimated capture probability and a final 80\% depletion of the asteroid belt during the subsequent giant planet instability, lead to capture 1 Ceres in the asteroid belt, with a probability of 15\%, 34\%, and 51\% to be located in the inner, middle and outer belt respectively.},

In this work, we provide evidence that reasonably large asteroids (diameter {$>$} 20 km) have high correlations with Gaia relative flux uncertainties and systematic right ascension errors.

  abstract = {On Aug 22, 2016, a bright fireball was observed by the Desert Fireball Network in South Australia. Its pre-atmosphere orbit suggests it was temporarily captured by the Earth-Moon system before impact. A search was conducted two years after the fall, and a meteorite was found after 6 days of searching. The meteorite appeared relatively fresh, had a mass consistent with fireball observation predictions, and was at the predicted location within uncertainties. However, the meteorite did show some weathering and lacked short-lived radionuclides (\$\^\{58\}\$Co, \$\^\{54\}\$Mn). A terrestrial age based on cosmogenic \$\^\{14\}\$C dating was determined; the meteorite has been on the Earth's surface for \$3.2\textbackslash pm1.3\$ kyr, ruling out it being connected to the 2016 fireball. Using an upper limit on the pleistieocene terrain age and the total searched area, we find that the contamination probability from another fall is \${$<$}2\textbackslash\%\$. Thus, the retrieval of the "wrong" meteorite is at odds with the contamination statistics. This is a key example to show that fireball-meteorite pairings should be carefully verified.},

  abstract = {Photometric light-curve inversion of minor planets has proven to produce a unique model solution only under the hypothesis that the asteroid is convex. However, it was suggested that the resulting shape model, for the case of non-convex asteroids, is the convex-hull of the true asteroid non-convex shape. While a convex shape is already useful to provide the overall aspect of the target, much information about real shapes is missed, as we know that asteroids are very irregular. It is a commonly accepted evidence that large flat areas sometimes appearing on shapes derived from light curves correspond to concave areas, but this information has not been further explored and exploited so far. We present in this paper a method that allows to predict the presence of concavities from such flat regions. This method analyses the distribution of the local normals to the facets composing shape models to predict the presence of abnormally large flat surfaces. In order to test our approach, we consider here its application to a large family of synthetic asteroid shapes, and to real asteroids with large-scale concavities, whose detailed shape is known by other kinds of observations (radar and spacecraft encounters). The method that we propose has proven to be reliable and capable of providing a qualitative indication of the relevance of concavities on well-constrained asteroid shapes derived from purely photometric data sets.},

Our measured water production rates from NIRSPEC and CSHELL observations remained relatively constant and were close to those from SOHO/Solar Wind ANisotropies observations that encompassed our dates, suggesting H2O production dominated by release directly from or within approximately 2000 km of the nucleus. All trace volatiles were depleted relative to their respective median abundances among comets, excepting NH3, which was consistent with its median abundance. Most surprising were pronounced increases in abundance ratios for CH3OH (by 51\% relative to simultaneously measured H2O) and especially C2H6 (by 87\%) between September 5 and 6. On September 5, C2H6 was severely depleted, consistent with its lowest abundance yet measured for any comet. It also tracked the spatial profile of H2O, suggesting C2H6 was associated with a polar ice phase dominating gas production. On September 6, C2H6 was only moderately depleted and was spatially distinct from H2O, suggesting both polar- and nonpolar-dominated ice phases contributed to the activity then. Our results are consistent with a nonhomogeneous volatile composition for C/2013 V5, implying differential processing of its constituent ices.},

Broadband photometry can be used to measure their phase curves, allowing a firstorder probe into the surface properties of these objects, though limited telescope time makes measuring accurate phase curves difficult. We make use of serendipitous broadband photometry from the long-baseline, high-cadence Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System survey to measure the phase curves for a sample of 18 KBOs, Centaurs, and JFCs with unprecedentedly large data sets. We find phase curves with previously reported negative slopes become positive with increased data and are thus due to insufficient sampling of the phase-curve profile, and not a real physical effect. We search for correlations between phase-curve parameters, finding no strong correlations between any parameter pair, consistent with the findings of previous studies. We search for instances of cometary activity in our sample, finding a previously reported outburst by Echeclus and a new epoch of increased activity by Chiron. Applying the main belt asteroid HG1G2 phase-curve model to three JFCs in our sample with large phase angle spans, we find their slope parameters imply surfaces more consistent with those of carbonaceous main belt asteroids than silicaceous ones.},

  abstract = {Even though dust coagulation is a very important dust-processing mechanism in interstellar space and protoplanetary disks, there are still important parts of the physics involved that are poorly understood. This imposes a serious problem for model calculations of any kind. In this paper, we attempt to improve the situation by including the e\textdagger ects of tangential forces on the contact in some detail. These have been studied in recent papers. We summarize the main results from these papers and apply them to detailed simulations of the coagulation process and of collisions between dust aggregates. Our results show the following : (1) the growth of aggregates by monomers will normally not involve major restructuring of the aggregates, (2) the classical hit-and-stick assumption is reasonably valid for this case, (3) collisions of aggregates with each other or with large grains can lead to signi\DH cant compaction, and (4) the results can be easily understood in terms of critical energies for di\textdagger erent restructuring processes. We also derive a short summary that may be used as a recipe for determining the outcome of collisions in coagulation calculations. It is shown that turbulent velocity \DH elds in interstellar clouds are capable of producing considerably compressed aggregates, while the small aggregates forming early on in the solar nebula will not be compacted by collisions. However, compaction provides an important energy sink in collisions of larger aggregates in the solar nebula.},

We report new r-band nucleus light curves for this comet, acquired in 2018, 2021, and 2022. With the addition of these light curves, the phase angles, at which the nucleus has been observed, range from 0.39{$\bigcirc$} to 16.33{$\bigcirc$}. We absolutely calibrate the comet light curves to r-band Pan-STARRS 1 magnitudes, and use these light curves to create a convex shape model of the nucleus by convex lightcurve inversion. The best-fitting shape model for 162P has axis ratios a/b = 1.56 and b/c = 2.33, sidereal period P = 32.864~{$\pm~$}0.001~h, and a rotation pole oriented towards ecliptic longitude {$\lambda$}E = 118{$\bigcirc$} {$\pm$} 26{$\bigcirc$} and latitude {$\beta$}E = -50{$\bigcirc$} {$\pm$} 21{$\bigcirc$}. We constrain the possible nucleus elongation to lie within 1.4 \&lt; a/b \&lt; 2.0 and discuss tentative evidence that 162P may have a bilobed structure. Using the shape model to correct the light curves for rotational effects, we derive a linear phase function with slope {$\beta$} = 0.051~{$\pm~$}0.002 mag\,deg-1 and intercept Hr(1, 1, 0) = 13.86~{$\pm~$}0.02 for 162P. We find no evidence that the nucleus exhibited an opposition surge at phase angles down to 0.39\textdegree. The challenges associated with modelling the shapes of comet nuclei from light curves are highlighted, and we comment on the extent to which we anticipate that Legacy Survey of Space and Time will alleviate these challenges in the coming decade.},

To find the best-fit model, we ran the inversion for tens of thousands of trial periods on interval 2-10,000 h, with tens of initial pole directions. To find the correct rotation period, we also used a triaxial ellipsoid model for the shape approximation. In most cases the number of data points was insufficient to uniquely determine the rotation period. However, for about 8600 asteroids we were able to determine the spin state uniquely together with a low-resolution convex shape model. This large sample of new asteroid models enables us to study the spin distribution in the asteroid population. The distribution of spins confirms previous findings that (i) small asteroids have poles clustered toward ecliptic poles, likely because of the YORP-induced spin evolution, (ii) asteroid migration due to the Yarkovsky effect depends on the spin orientation, and (iii) members of asteroid families have the sense of rotation correlated with their proper semimajor axis: over the age of the family, orbits of prograde rotators evolved, due to the Yarkovsky effect, to larger semimajor axes, while those of retrograde rotators drifted in the opposite direction.},

For thousands of asteroids, their best-fit period was the same for most of the bootstrapped data sets; thus, their rotation period was determined with a high degree of reliability.},

  abstract = {The Trojan asteroids, a very substantial population of primitive bodies trapped in Jupiter's stable Lagrange regions, remain quite poorly understood. Because they occupy these orbits, the physical properties of Trojans provide a unique perspective on the chemical and dynamical processes that shaped the Solar System. The current study was therefore undertaken to investigate surface compositions of these objects. We present 66 new near-infrared (NIR; 0.7\textendash 2.5 {$\mu$}m) spectra of 58 Trojan asteroids, including members of both the leading and trailing swarms. We also include in the analysis previously published NIR spectra of 13 Trojans (3 of which overlap with the new sample). This data set permits not only a direct search for compositional signatures, but also a search for patterns that may reveal clues to the origin of the Trojans. We do not report any confirmed absorption features in the new spectra. Analysis of the spectral slopes, however, reveals an interesting bimodality among the NIR data. The two spectral groups identified appear to be equally abundant in the leading and trailing swarms. The spectral groups are not a result of family membership; they occur in the background, non-family population. The average albedos of the two groups are the same within uncertainties (0.051 {$\pm$} 0.016 and 0.055 {$\pm$} 0.016). No correlations between spectral slope and any other physical or orbital parameter are detected, with the exception of a possible weak correlation with inclination among the less-red spectral group. The NIR spectral groups are consistent with a similar bimodality previously suggested among visible colors and spectra. Synthesizing the present results with previously published properties of Trojans, we conclude that the two spectral groups represent objects with different intrinsic compositions. We further suggest that whereas the less-red group originated near Jupiter or in the main asteroid belt, the redder spectral group originated farther out in the Solar System. If this suggestion is correct, the Trojan swarms offer the most readily accessible large reservoir of Kuiper Belt material as well as a unique reservoir for the study of material from the middle part of the solar nebula.},

Space missions, telescopic observations and laboratory analyses advanced the knowledge on the properties of cometary dust. Cometary samples were returned from comet 81P/Wild2 by the Stardust mission. The chondritic (porous) anhydrous interplanetary dust particles and chondritic porous micrometeorites, and the ultracarbonaceous Antarctic micrometeorites (UCAMMs) also show strong evidence for a cometary origin. The composition of cometary dust is generally chondritic, but with high C and N compared with CI. The cometary organic matter is mixed with minor amounts of crystalline and amorphous minerals. The most abundant crystalline minerals are ferromagnesian silicates, refractory minerals and low Ni Fe sulfides are also present. The presence of carbonates in cometary dust is still debated, but a phyllosilicate-like phase was observed in a UCAMM. GEMS phases are usually abundant. Some of the organic matter present in cometary dust particle resembles the insoluble organic matter present in primitive meteorites, but amorphous carbon and exotic (e.g. N-rich) organic phases are also present. The H isotopic composition of the organic matter traces a formation at very low temperatures, in the protosolar cloud or in the outer regions of the protoplanetary disk. The presolar dust concentration in cometary dust can reach about 1\%, which is the most elevated value observed in extraterrestrial samples. The differential size distribution of cometary dust in comet trails is well represented by a power-law distribution with a mean power index N typically ranging from -3 to -4. Polarimetric and light scattering studies suggest mixtures of porous agglomerates of sub-micrometer minerals with organic matter. Cometary dust particles have low tensile strength, and low density.},

Our colour index (V-R) measurement of 0.45~\hspace{0pt}{$\pm~$}\hspace{0pt}0.02 is consistent with spectroscopic observations, indicating an S (or sub-S) spectral type. Using the polarimetric and spectroscopic data, we found that the geometric albedo is 0.15~\hspace{0pt}{$\pm~$}\hspace{0pt}0.03, and the spectral type is Sq. Based on the estimated albedo and absolute magnitude, Baboquivari has an effective diameter of 2.12~\hspace{0pt}{$\pm~$}\hspace{0pt}0.21~\hspace{0pt}km.

  abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

Our dynamical analysis shows that the object has probably originated in the Oort cloud, however an interstellar origin cannot be discarded. The observations were obtained in 2018 and 2019 using the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph (GHTS) at the SOAR telescope. We obtained visible spectra covering the wavelength range of 0.5-0.9 {$\mu$}m and also images in the SDSS filters system. Both the low-resolution reflectance spectrum and the reflectance spectra derived from the SDSS filters show an atypical band at {$\sim$} 0.595 {$\mu$}m. We conducted a comparative study of the colors and reflectance spectra of different small body populations (e.g., comets, Centaurs, and trans-Neptunian objects or TNOs) from the literature and concluded that the spectra and the colors of this comet are atypical, showing only some overlap with those of some known members of the TNOs and Centaurs, within the large uncertainties of the measurements of those populations. It is found that the feature and overall spectral shape can be reproduced by laboratory spectra of kerite, a template for aliphatic-rich hydrocarbons that has been previously identified in NIR cometary spectra absorptions. It is tentatively proposed that the unusual spectral shape is the result of a particle size distribution of dust grains in the coma or on the surface that has arisen due to a low grain ejection velocity from the surface and large nucleus size.},

The comet approached the Sun, down to 0.3 au, in early 2020 July, providing a spectacular perihelion passage and revealing itself as one of the brightest comets that have appeared in the northern hemisphere in recent decades. Daytime observations with iSHELL/IRTF were performed to study the comet immediately after its perihelion passage, from 9 July to 1 August. In early August, a DDT at Keck Observatory was requested to continue following the comet with NIRSPEC 2.0. We acquired comprehensive high-resolution spectra of the comet as it progressively retreated from perihelion. We detected many cometary emission lines in the (2.8\textendash 5.3) {$\mu$}m range, identifying 12 molecular species: 9 primary volatiles (H2O, HCN, NH3, CO, C2H2, C2H6, CH4, CH3OH, and H2CO) and 3 product species (CN, NH2, OH). In this paper, we present the analysis and discussion of the molecular abundances found in this comet, and we compare them to reference median values for Oort Cloud Comets. Measured molecular mixing ratios showed drastic changes during our observing campaign, which spanned nearly one month from 2020 July 9 to August 6. Here, we provide a detailed discussion of the molecular spatial distributions and their role in identifying the presence of extended sources in the coma.

The high-resolution spectra of 21P were acquired using iSHELL\textemdash the near-infrared high-resolution immersion echelle spectrograph on NASA/IRTF (Maunakea, Hawaii). We detected many cometary emission lines across four customized iSHELL settings in the (2.9\textendash 5.2) {$\mu$}m range. CO abundances relative to water displayed a relatively constant behavior during the observing campaign, suggesting a possible correlation between the outgassing of water and CO. While CO mixing ratios in 21P are consistent with the reference median value for Jupiter family comets (JFCs), ethane was depleted relative to the reference median value for JFCs, except for one observing run (August 8 and 9) in which ethane appeared overabundant. We consider several possible causes: an ethane outburst, decreasing outgassing of water, or a seasonal effect owing to nucleus rotation. In the pre-perihelion runs, methanol was overabundant compared with the reference median value for JFCs, however it decreased steadily to a depleted value during 21P's post-perihelion phase, suggesting a possible seasonal effect. We report 3{$\sigma$} upper limits for acetylene, formaldehyde, ammonia, and methane. The ratios of our measured 3{$\sigma$} upper limits for acetylene and detections of hydrogen cyanide are consistent with the depletion of C2 relative to CN in 21P observed at optical wavelengths. This result confirms that 21P is depleted in the carbon-chain primary volatile responsible for C2 production.},

We identified 12 molecular species: nine primary volatiles (H2O, HCN, NH3, CO, C2H2, C2H6, CH4, CH3OH, H2CO) and three product species (CN, NH2, OH). We detected 85 H2O emission lines from 12 water vibrational bands across L1-c and M1 settings. The many detected water emission lines enabled retrieval of accurate measures for ortho- and para-H2O independently, thereby reducing systematic uncertainty in the derived ortho\textendash para ratio and nuclear spin temperature. Excitation analyses and emission profile analyses were performed for all species, and molecular abundance ratios relative to water are compared with values found for other Oort Cloud comets in our infrared database. Abundance ratios are consistent for most species, with the exception of underabundantmethanol and overabundant ammonia in E4.},

  abstract = {Context. The occultation of a radio source by the plasma tail of a comet can be used to probe structure and dynamics in the tail. Such occultations are rare, and the occurrence of scintillation, due to small-scale density variations in the tail, remains somewhat controversial. Aims. A detailed observation taken with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) of a serendipitous occultation of the compact radio source 3C196 by the plasma tail of comet C/2020 F3 (Neowise) is presented. 3C196 tracked almost perpendicularly behind the tail, providing a unique profile cut only a short distance downstream from the cometary nucleus itself. Methods. Interplanetary scintillation (IPS) is observed as the rapid variation of the intensity received of a compact radio source due to density variations in the solar wind. IPS in the signal received from 3C196 was observed for five hours, covering the full transit behind the plasma tail of comet C/2020 F3 (Neowise) on 16 July 2020, and allowing an assessment of the solar wind in which the comet and its tail are embedded. Results. The results reveal a sudden and strong enhancement in scintillation which is unequivocally attributable to the plasma tail. The strongest scintillation is associated with the tail boundaries, weaker scintillation is seen within the tail, and previously-unreported periodic variations in scintillation are noted, possibly associated with individual filaments of plasma. Furthermore, contributions from the solar wind and comet tail are separated to measure a sharp decrease in the velocity of material within the tail, suggesting a steep velocity shear resulting in strong turbulence along the tail boundary},

  abstract = {We investigate the Kozai mechanism in the context of near-Earth binaries and the Sun. The Kozai effect can lead to changes in eccentricity and inclination of the binary orbit, but it can be weakened or completely suppressed by other sources of pericenter precession, such as the oblateness of the primary body. Through numerical integrations including primary oblateness and three bodies (the two binary components and the Sun), we show that Kozai cycles cannot occur for the closely separated near-Earth binaries in our sample. We demonstrate that this is due to pericenter precession around the oblate primary, even for very small oblateness values. Since the majority of observed near-Earth binaries are not well separated, we predict that Kozai cycles do not play an important role in the orbital evolution of most near-Earth binaries. For a hypothetical wide binary modeled after 1998 ST27, the separation is large at 16 primary radii and so the orbital effects of primary oblateness are lessened. For this wide binary, we illustrate the possible excursions in eccentricity and inclination due to Kozai cycles as well as depict stable orientations for the binary's orbital plane. Unstable orientations lead to collisions between binary components, and we suggest that the Kozai effect acting in wide binaries may be a route to the formation of near-Earth contact binaries.},

The MRO spacecraft, in orbit around Mars, used its HiRISE camera to monitor the comet during the encounter, obtaining the first resolved images of the nucleus of a dynamically new comet.MRO observed Siding Spring from 60 hr before, to 15 hr after close approach, obtaining 122 images in three different color filters. Close approach images, with a spatial scale as small as 138 m/pix, reveal an elongated crescent that changes shape over the course of the sequence, indicating that we are seeing a \textasciitilde 1 km non-spherical body from different viewpoints as the comet rapidly sweeps past. To better constrain the characteristics of the nucleus, we are performing detailed analyses, including modeling of the inner coma to separate its flux contribution from that of the nucleus. In conjunction with the coma removal, we will model the nucleus as a prolate/triaxial ellipsoid and, combined with the known illumination and viewing conditions, will use the changing aspect in the images to constrain the size, shape, orientation, albedo and possibly the phase dependence of the nucleus.In addition to the close approach observations, the images before and after close approach capture the coma structure and brightness. The photometric lightcurve from these images shows variability with an 8.1 hr period, which is presumed to be the rotational modulation of the coma activity. The observed morphology changes as well, promising to provide a measure of the nucleus' spin axis orientation.We will report on the results from our analyses, and provide the first direct measurements of the nucleus of a dynamically new comet.},

  abstract = {We report a statistically significant detection of nongravitational acceleration on the sub-kilometer near-Earth asteroid (523599) 2003 RM. Due to its orbit, 2003 RM experiences favorable observing apparitions every 5 years. Thus, since its discovery, 2003 RM has been extensively tracked with ground-based optical facilities in 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2018. We find that the observed plane-of-sky positions cannot be explained with a purely gravity-driven trajectory. Including a transverse nongravitational acceleration allows us to match all observational data, but its magnitude is inconsistent with perturbations typical of asteroids such as the Yarkovsky effect or solar radiation pressure. After ruling out that the orbital deviations are due to a close approach or collision with another asteroid, we hypothesize that this anomalous acceleration is caused by unseen cometary outgassing. A detailed search for cometary activity with archival and deep observations from Pan-STARRS and the VLT does not reveal any detectable dust production. However, the best-fitting H\$\_2\$O sublimation model allows for brightening due to activity consistent with the scatter of the data. We estimate the production rate required for H\$\_2\$O outgassing to power the acceleration, and find that, assuming a diameter of 300 m, 2003 RM would require Q(H\$\_2\$O)\$\textbackslash sim10\^\{23\}\$ molec s\$\^\{-1\}\$ at perihelion. We investigate the recent dynamical history of 2003 RM and find that the object most likely originated in the mid-to-outer main belt (\$\textbackslash sim86\textbackslash\%\$) as opposed to from the Jupiter-family comet region (\$\textbackslash sim11\textbackslash\%\$). Further observations, especially in the infrared, could shed light on the nature of this anomalous acceleration.},

This work is the first in a series dedicated to detecting and analyzing SSOs in the all-sky NOIRLab Source Catalog (NSC). We search the first data release of the NSC with CANFind, a Computationally Automated NSC tracklet Finder. NSC DR1 contains 34 billion measurements of 2.9 billion unique objects, which CANFind categorizes as belonging to ``stationary'' (distant stars, galaxies) or moving (SSOs) objects via an iterative clustering method. Detections of stationary bodies for proper motion \textmu{} {$\leq$}2.5 hr-1(0.017{$\smwhtcircle$}day-1) are identified and analyzed separately. Remaining detections belonging to high-\textmu{} objects are clustered together over single nights to form ``tracklets''. Each tracklet contains detections of an individual moving object, and is validated based on spatial linearity and motion through time. Proper motions are then calculated and used to connect tracklets and other unassociated measurements over multiple nights by predicting their locations at common times, forming ``tracks''. This method extracted 527,055 tracklets from NSC DR1 in an area covering 29,971 square degrees of the sky. The data show distinct groups of objects with similar observed \textmu{} in ecliptic coordinates, namely Main Belt Asteroids, Jupiter Trojans, and Kuiper Belt Objects. Apparent magnitudes range from 10\textendash 25 mag in the ugrizY and VR bands. Color-color diagrams show a bimodality of tracklets between primarily carbonaceous and siliceous groups, supporting prior studies.},

  abstract = {Asteroid pairs are genetically related asteroids that recently separated (\${$<\$$}few million years), but still reside on similar heliocentric orbits. A few hundred of these systems have been identified, primarily in the asteroid main-belt. Here we studied a newly discovered pair of near-Earth objects (NEOs): 2019 PR2 and 2019 QR6. Based on broadband photometry, we found these asteroids to be spectrally similar to D-types, a type rare amongst NEOs. We recovered astrometric observations for both asteroids from the Catalina Sky Survey from 2005, which significantly improved their fitted orbits. With these refinements we ran backwards orbital integrations to study formation and evolutionary history. We found that neither a pure gravitational model nor a model with the Yarkovsky effect could explain their current orbits. We thus implemented two models of comet-like non-gravitational forces based on water or CO sublimation. The first model assumed quasi-continuous, comet-like activity after separation, which suggested a formation time of the asteroid pair \$300\^\{+120\}\_\{-70\}\$ years ago. The second model assumed short-term activity for up to one heliocentric orbit (\$\textbackslash sim\$13.9 years) after separation, which suggested that the pair formed 272\$\textbackslash pm\$7 years ago. Image stacks showed no activity for 2019\textasciitilde PR2 during its last perihelion passage. These results strongly argue for a common origin that makes these objects the youngest asteroid pair known to date. Questions remain regarding whether these objects derived from a parent comet or asteroid, and how activity may have evolved since their separation.},

  abstract = {Proper elements are quasi-integrals of motion, meaning that they can be considered constant over a certain timespan, and they permit to describe the long-term evolution with a few parameters. Near-Earth objects (NEOs) generally have a large eccentricity and therefore they can cross the orbits of the planets. Moreover, some of them are known to be currently in a mean-motion resonance with a planet. Thus, the methods previously used for the computation of main-belt asteroid proper elements are not appropriate for such objects. In this paper, we introduce a technique for the computation of proper elements of planet-crossing asteroids that are in a mean-motion resonance with a planet. First, we numerically average the Hamiltonian over the fast angles while keeping all the resonant terms, and we describe how to continue a solution beyond orbit crossing singularities. Proper elements are then extracted from a frequency analysis of the averaged orbit-crossing solutions. We give proper elements of some known resonant NEOs, and provide comparisons with non-resonant models. These examples show that it is necessary to take into account the effect of the resonance for the computation of accurate proper elements.},

MBCs and candidates show stronger clustering of their longitudes of perihelion around 15\{\textbackslash deg\} than other objects from the Outer Main Belt (OMB). This potential property of MBCs could facilitate the discovery of new candidates by observing objects in similar orbits. We acquired deep r-band images of 534 targeted asteroids using the INT/WFC between 2018 and 2020. Our sample is comprised of OMB objects observed near perihelion, with longitudes of perihelion between 0\{\textbackslash deg\} and 30\{\textbackslash deg\} and orbital parameters similar to knowns MBCs. Our pipeline applied activity detection methods to 319 of these objects to look for tails or comae, and we visually inspected the remaining asteroids. Our activity detection pipeline highlighted a faint anti-solar tail-like feature around 2001 NL19 (279870) observed on 2018 November 07, six months after perihelion. This is consistent with cometary activity but additional observations of this object will be needed during its next perihelion to investigate its potential MBC status. If it is active our survey yields a detection rate of \$\textbackslash sim\$1:300, which is higher than previous similar surveys, supporting the idea of dynamical clustering of MBCs.

We obtained high accuracy astrometric data to refine the prediction, resulting in a shadow path favorable for the Iberian Peninsula. This encouraged us to carry out an occultation observation campaign that resulted in five positive detections from four observing sites. This is the fourth centaur for which a multichord (more than two chords) stellar occultation has been observed so far, the other three being (2060) Chiron, (10199) Chariklo, and (95626) 2002 GZ\$\_\{32\}\$.

This diameter is \$\textbackslash sim30\$ km smaller than the one obtained from thermal measurements. The position angle of the short axis of the best fitting ellipse obtained through the analysis of the stellar occultation does not match that of the spin axis derived from long-term photometric models.

We present different scenarios to reconcile the results from the different techniques. We did not detect secondary drops related to potential rings or satellites.

Indeed, one of our targets, 2001 OG108, became active again a few months after our observations. We find a very strong correlation between the albedo distribution and TJ, with the percentage of dark TJ {$<$} 3 asteroids being much greater than that of the TJ {$>$} 3 NEAs. There are 10 NEAs among the 32 objects, and of those, 53\% \AE{} 9\% have comet-like albedos. With the current crop of NEAs, this implies that about 4\% of all known NEAs are extinct comets. A comparison of the histogram of TJ {$<$} 3 asteroid albedos with that of active cometary nuclei shows that the former has a larger spread.},

  abstract = {We present results from SEPPCoN, an on-going Survey of the Ensemble Physical Properties of Cometary Nuclei. In this report we discuss mid-infrared measurements of the thermal emission from 89 nuclei of Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). All data were obtained in 2006 and 2007 using imaging capabilities of the Spitzer Space Telescope. The comets were typically 4-5 AU from the Sun when observed and most showed only a point-source with little or no extended emission from dust. For those comets showing dust, we used image processing to photometrically extract the nuclei. For all 89 comets, we present new effective radii, and for 57 comets we present beaming parameters. Thus our survey provides the largest compilation of radiometrically-derived physical properties of nuclei to date. We have six main conclusions: (a) The average beaming parameter of the JFC population is 1.03 {$\pm$} 0.11, consistent with unity; coupled with the large distance of the nuclei from the Sun, this indicates that most nuclei have Tempel 1-like thermal inertia. Only two of the 57 nuclei had outlying values (in a statistical sense) of infrared beaming. (b) The known JFC population is not complete even at 3 km radius, and even for comets that approach to {$\sim$}2 AU from the Sun and so ought to be more discoverable. Several recently-discovered comets in our survey have small perihelia and large (above {$\sim$}2 km) radii. (c) With our radii, we derive an independent estimate of the JFC nuclear cumulative size distribution (CSD), and we find that it has a power-law slope of around -1.9, with the exact value depending on the bounds in radius. (d) This power-law is close to that derived by others from visible-wavelength observations that assume a fixed geometric albedo, suggesting that there is no strong dependence of geometric albedo with radius. (e) The observed CSD shows a hint of structure with an excess of comets with radii 3-6 km. (f) Our CSD is consistent with the idea that the intrinsic size distribution of the JFC population is not a simple power-law and lacks many sub-kilometer objects.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} Understanding the conditions that lead to the formation of planetesimals \textendash{} the building blocks of planets - and their initial size distribution is a central problem of modern planetology. While most of these original planetesimals were accreted onto the terrestrial planets and the cores of the giant planets, some were also stranded in the main belt, where 4.5 Gyr of collisional evolution broke most of them into families of collisional asteroid fragments. However, some planetesimals survived, and are still hidden amongst asteroid fragments in the main belt.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We make use of astronomical data to identify these leftover planetesimals amongst all other asteroids. Our search is based on separating planetesimal survivors from families of asteroids generated by collisions. Namely, we aim to identify and ``clean'' the main belt of collisional family members: by doing so, we would be left with the surviving members of the original planetesimals.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We focus here on the inner portion of the main belt for asteroids with intermediate to high albedo. It is known that current asteroid family catalogs are not suitable for the aforementioned cleaning; they are conservative and only one-quarter of the known asteroids are associated with the approximately 120 distinct asteroid families. We therefore developed methods to inclusively link asteroids to known collisional families in order to better capture their extent. Namely, we apply a hierarchical clustering method (HCM) on asteroids filtered according to the V-shape of the Yarkovsky drift of each family in order to reassess family membership (V-shape-constrained HCM). The identified families were removed and the remaining background population was searched for previously undetected collisional families.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We succeed in using our V-shape-constrained HCM to link family ``halos'' to their cores. After removing these reassessed families from the asteroid population, our V-shape search reveals a previously unknown collisional family of S-type asteroids in the inner main belt with an age of 4.3 {$\pm$} 1.7 Gyr and a significance level of 3.4\emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}. When this ancient collisional family is removed, 34 planetesimals are identified and their size-frequency distribution is presented.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} The asteroid belt has two components: planetesimals and collisional fragments. The cumulative size-frequency distribution of planetesimals has a steep power-law index for bodies larger than 100 km in diameter and a much smaller power-law index for planetesimals smaller than 100 km.}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Thanks to Rosetta orbiter's and Philae lander's data our knowledge of cometary nuclei composition has experienced a great advancement. The properties of 67P/CG nucleus are discussed and compared with other comets explored in the past by space missions. Cometary nuclei are made by a collection of ices, minerals, organic matter, and salts resulting in very dark and red-colored surfaces. When far from the Sun, exposed water and carbon dioxide ices are found only in few locations of 67P/CG where the exposure of pristine subsurface layers or the recondensation of volatile species driven by the solar heating and local terrain morphology can sustain their temporary presence on the surface. The nucleus surface appears covered by a dust layer of variable thickness. Dust grains appear mostly dehydrated and are made by an assemblage of minerals, organic matter, and salts. Spectral analysis shows that the mineral phase is dominated by silicates, fine-grained opaques and ammoniated salts. Aliphatic and aromatic groups, with the presence of the strong hydroxyl group, are identified within the organic matter. The surface composition of cometary nuclei evolves with heliocentric distance and seasonal cycling: approaching perihelion the increase of the solar flux boosts the activity through the sublimation of volatiles which in turn causes the erosion of surface layers, the exposure of ices, the activity in cliffs and pits, the collapse of overhangs and walls, and the mobilization and redistribution of dust. The evolution of color, composition, and texture changes occurring across different morphological regions of the nucleus are correlated with these processes. In this chapter we discuss 67P/CG nucleus composition and evolutionary processes as observed by Rosetta mission in the context of other comets previously explored by space missions or observed from Earth.},

  abstract = {Dione, Rhea, and the trailing side of Mimas. Conversely, the dark and red-colored material visible across the trailing hemispheres of Tethys, Dione, and Rhea is associated with the implantation of cold plasma particles. The thermal anomaly lenses located on the leading equatorial regions of Mimas and Tethys have been resolved and mapped. VIMS data evidence that the distribution of water ice band depths on Mimas lens is biased by the presence of the large Herschel impact crater pointing to a different regolith size distribution with respect to Tethys. Maps show local changes of albedo and spectral indicators in correspondence of recent impact craters (Inktomi on Rhea, Creusa on Dione) and on Dione's wispy terrains are caused by the exposure of pristine water ice. Enceladus' tiger stripes, the active sources of plumes in the southern polar region, despite being partially resolved on VIMS maps allow measuring an exceedingly high band depths in comparison with the rest of the satellite's surface. Moreover, Enceladus' smooth terrains located on the leading hemisphere around (lon, lat) = (90{$\smwhtcircle$}, 30{$\smwhtcircle$}) show peculiar properties (low infrared albedo, positive 0.35-0.55 \textmu m slope and maximum band depth) possibly associated with the presence of a buried diapir in this area. The variability of average spectral albedos and indicators induced by phase angle is investigated and exploited to establish a comparison among satellites' properties as a function of orbital distance from Saturn.},

All spectra were obtained with the 154 cm Mount Bigelow telescope of the University of Arizona Observatories, using our fast f/1.2 spectrograph and an 800 x 800 TI CCD detector. Roughly 21 of the objects observed displayed emissions while the other 18 simply yielded a continuum, although three of these gave a suggestion of possible CN emission. Emission fluxes were measured for the {$\Delta\upsilon$} = -1 C2 Swan band, the 0,10,0 and 0,8,0 NH2 bands, the O I 1D line at 6300 \AA{} and the red CN system 2-0 and 1-0 bands. From these fluxes, production rates for the parents of C2, NH2, O I, and CN were determined and mixing ratios of the parents of C2, NH2, and CN with respect to H2O were calculated. We estimate our standard deviation error in these numbers to be about 10\%. We find that about 10\% of the comets have deviant composition with the most common being the P/Giacobini-Zinner class and the most unusual represented by Yanaka (1988r). The other 90\% of our comet sample shows reasonably uniform mixing ratios with maximum comet-to-comet variations of a factor of 2-3 and a standard deviation of {$\sim$}30\%. No distinct compositional classes could be discerned within that group. We interpret the observed spread in production rate ratios as chemical composition variations between individual comets and a measure of the nonuniformity of the solar nebula during the time of the solar system formation.},

Differential photometry with field stars has allowed us to detect a periodic modulation in the light curve attributed to the the rotation of the nucleus, implying a spin period of 8.34 hours.

The images were taken through a 1 {$\mu$}m wide filter centered at 11.65 {$\mu$}m. During the observing run, the heliocentric distance decreased from 1.13 to 0.98 AU, and the geocentric distance increased from 1.16 to 1.33 AU. The spatial scale of the images was 700-800 km per pixel. In addition, photometric data at wavelengths between 3.6 and 18.5 {$\mu$}m were obtained on one night. The infrared images cover the cometary activity on time scales from hours to weeks and reveal large changes in the overall morphology of the coma. From periodic changes in the jet patterns we determined the period of nuclear rotation of 67{$\pm$}0.4 h. Photometry indicates that the temperature of the coma was 35\% higher than the blackbody temperature at the same heliocentric distance and, hence, that the coma was dominated by small particles of average radius of 0.7 {$\mu$}m. The dust mass loss rate varied with the heliocentric distance as R-6.3 and displayed {$\sim$}40\% variation with the rotational phase. Two major jets were present in the images obtained on November 07-17, and a third area became active on November 24-29, increasing the average dust loss rate by a factor of 1.4. The relative positions of the three active areas on the surface of the nucleus are consistent with the positions of the most stable active zones identified by Sekanina [AJ, 86, 1741(1981)] from the data on the P/Swift-Tuttle apparition in 1862. The radial brightness profiles suggest the radius of the nucleus is 15{$\pm$}3 km. This implies that the nucleus of P/Swift-Tuttle is {$\sim$}34 times more massive than the nucleus of P/Halley.},

In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort.

We perform direct long-term numerical integrations that enable us to examine the overall dynamics of the individual TNOs as well as to identify all MMRs. For the latter purpose, we apply the own-developed FAIR method that allows the semi-automatic identification of even very high-order MMRs. Apart from searching for the more frequent eccentricity-type resonances that previous studies concentrated on, we set our method to allow the identification of inclination-type MMRs, too. Furthermore, we distinguish between TNOs that are locked in the given MMR throughout the whole integration time span (\$10\^8\$\textbackslash,years) and those that are only temporarily captured in resonances. For a more detailed dynamical analysis of the trans-Neptunian space, we also construct dynamical maps using test particles. Observing the fine structure of the \$ 34-80 \$\textasciitilde AU region underlines the stabilizing role of the MMRs, with the regular regions coinciding with the position of the real TNOs.},

  abstract = {The identification of mean motion resonances in exoplanetary systems or in the Solar system might be cumbersome when several planets and large number of smaller bodies are to be considered. Based on the geometrical meaning of the resonance variable, an efficient method is introduced and described here, by which mean motion resonances can be easily find without any a priori knowledge on them. The efficiency of this method is clearly demonstrated by using known exoplanets engaged in mean motion resonances, and also some members of different families of asteroids and Kuiper belt objects being in mean motion resonances with Jupiter and Neptune, respectively.},

  abstract = {Methods. We analyzed more than 2000 images from NAC color sequences acquired with 7\textendash 11 filters covering the 250\textendash 1000 nm wavelength range. The OSIRIS images were processed with the OSIRIS standard pipeline up to level 3, that is, converted in radiance factor, then corrected for the illumination conditions. For each color sequence, color cubes were produced by stacking registered and illumination-corrected images. Results. More than 200 jets of different intensities were identified directly on the nucleus. Some of the more intense outbursts appear spectrally bluer than the comet dark terrain in the visible-to-near-infrared region. We attribute this spectral behavior to icy grains mixed with the ejected dust. Some of the jets have an extremely short lifetime. They appear on the cometary surface during the color sequence observations, and vanish in less than some few minutes after reaching their peak. We also report a resolved dust plume observed in May 2016 at a resolution of 55 cm pixel-1, which allowed us to estimate an optical depth of {$\sim$}0.65 and an ejected mass of {$\sim$}2200 kg, assuming a grain bulk density of {$\sim$}800 kg m-3. We present the results on the location, duration, and colors of active sources on the nucleus of 67P from the medium-resolution (i.e., 6\textendash 10 m pixel-1) images acquired close to perihelion passage. The observed jets are mainly located close to boundaries between different morphological regions. Some of these active areas were observed and investigated at higher resolution (up to a few decimeter per pixel) during the last months of operations of the Rosetta mission. Conclusions. These observations allow us to investigate the link between morphology, composition, and activity of cometary nuclei. Jets depart not only from cliffs, but also from smooth and dust-covered areas, from fractures, pits, or cavities that cast shadows and favor the recondensation of volatiles. This study shows that faint jets or outbursts continuously contribute to the cometary activity close to perihelion passage, and that these events are triggered by illumination conditions. Faint jets or outbursts are not associated with a particular terrain type or morphology.},

  abstract = {Methods. We analyzed medium- and high-resolution images acquired with the Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) of OSIRIS at several wavelengths in the 250\textendash 1000 nm range, investigating images from 109 different color sequences taken between August 2014 and September 2016, and covering spatial resolution from a few m px-1 to 0.1 m px-1. To identify the icy bright spots, we adopted the following criteria: (i) they should be at least 50\% brighter than the comet dark terrain; (ii) they should have neutral to moderate spectral slope values in the visible range (535\textendash 882 nm); (iii) they should be larger than 3 pixels. Results. We identified more than 600 volatile exposures on the comet, and we analyzed them in a homogeneous way. Bright spots are found isolated on the nucleus or grouped in clusters, usually at the bottom of cliffs, and most of them are small, typically a few square meters or smaller. The isolated ones are observed in different types of morphological terrains, including smooth surfaces, on top of boulders, or close to irregular structures. Several of them are clearly correlated with the cometary activity, being the sources of jets or appearing after an activity event. We note a number of peculiar exposures of volatiles with negative spectral slope values in the high-resolution post-perihelion images, which we interpret as the presence of large ice grains ({$>$}1000 \textmu m) or local frosts condensation. We observe a clear difference both in the spectral slope and in the area distributions of the bright spots pre- and post-perihelion, with these last having lower average spectral slope values and a smaller size, with a median surface of 0.7 m2, even if the size difference is mainly due to the higher resolution achieved post-perihelion. The minimum duration of the bright spots shows three clusters: an areaindependent cluster dominated by short-lifetime frosts; an area-independent cluster with lifetime of 0.5\textendash 2 days, probably associated with the seasonal fallout of dehydrated chunks; and an area-dependent cluster with lifetime longer than 2 days consistent with waterdriven erosion of the nucleus. Conclusions. Even if numerous bright spots are detected, the total surface of exposed water ice is less than 50 000 m2, which is 0.1\% of the total 67P nucleus surface. This confirms that the surface of comet 67P is dominated by refractory dark terrains, while exposed ice occupies only a tiny fraction. High spatial resolution is mandatory to identify ice on cometary nuclei surfaces. Moreover, the abundance of volatile exposures is six times less in the small lobe than in the big lobe, adding additional evidence to the hypothesis that comet 67P is composed of two distinct bodies. The fact that the majority of the bright spots identified have a surface lower than 1 m2 supports a model in which water ice enriched blocks (WEBs) of 0.5\textendash 1 m size should be homogeneously distributed in the cometary nucleus embedded in a refractory matrix.},

We present the current state of the survey and data analysis. Recognizing that the optical colours of most icy bodies broadly follow the reddening curve, we present a new projection of the optical-NIR colours, which rectifies the main non-linear features in the optical-NIR along the ordinates. We find evidence for a bifurcation in the projected colours which presents itself as a diagonal empty region in the optical-NIR. A reanalysis of past colour surveys reveals the same bifurcation. We interpret this as evidence for two separate surface classes: the BrightIR class spans the full range of optical colours and broadly follows the reddening curve, while the FaintIR objects are limited in optical colour, and are less bright in the NIR than the BrightIR objects. We present a two class model. Objects in each class consist of a mix of separate blue and red materials, and span a broad range in colour. Spectra are modelled as linear optical and NIR spectra with different slopes, that intersect at some transition wavelength. The underlying spectral properties of the two classes fully reproduce the observed structures in the UV-optical-NIR colour space (\$0.4\textbackslash lesssim\textbackslash lambda\textbackslash lesssim1.4 \textbackslash mbox\{ \$\textbackslash mu\$m\}\$), including the bifurcation observed in the Col-OSSOS and H/WTSOSS datasets, the tendency for cold classical KBOs to have lower (r-z) colours than excited objects, and the well known bimodal optical colour distribution.},

TNOs offer a different window than the JFCs, of more primordial bodies and over a different size and temperature range. It is in that context that this chapter is written. Here we discuss the dynamical pathways taken from the trans-Neptunian region to the JFCs, and the most important properties of TNOs that relate to the JFC population, including considerations of their origins, compositions, morphologies, and size distributions. We relate these properties to the JFCs whenever possible. We reflect on a few key outstanding issues regarding our incomplete knowledge of TNOs as they pertain to the Centaurs and JFC populations. We finish with a short discussion of notable new and upcoming facilities and the impacts they will have regarding these outstanding questions.},

For silicates a comprehensive picture already exists, which describes under which conditions growth can take place and which barriers must be overcome. With increasing distance to the central star volatiles freeze out and the collision dynamics is governed by the properties of the frozen volatiles. We present a novel experiment facility to analyze collisions of CO               2               agglomerates consisting of micrometer-sized particles with agglomerate sizes up to 100               {$\mu$}               m. Experiments are conducted at temperatures around 100 K with collision velocities up to 3.4 m s               -1               . Below impact velocities of around 0.1 m s               -1               sticking is observed and at collision velocities of 1 m s               -1               fragmentation also starts to occur. The experiments show that agglomerates of CO               2               ice behave like silicate agglomerates with a comparable grain size distribution. Models developed to describe the collision dynamics of silicate dust can be applied to CO               2               ice. This holds for the coefficient of restitution as well as for the threshold conditions for the transitions between sticking, bouncing, or fragmentation.},

Typical impact monitoring analyses search for possible impacts over the next 100 yr and none of the km-sized objects represent an impact threat over that time interval. Assessing the impact risk over longer timescales is a challenge since orbital uncertainties grow. To overcome this limitation we analyze the evolution of the minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID), which bounds the closest possible encounters between the asteroid and the Earth. The evolution of the MOID highlights NEOs that are in the vicinity of the Earth for longer periods of time, and we propose a method to estimate the probability of a deep Earth encounter during these periods. This metric is used to rank the km-sized catalog in terms of their long-term impact hazard to identify targets of potential interest for additional observation and exploration.},

We discuss observations of dust tails at heliocentric distances larger than 4 au in order to retrieve the physical parameters driving cometary activity beyond Jupiter by means of a probabilistic tail model, which is consistent with the activity model defining the gas coma parameters due to the sublimation of carbon monoxide, molecular oxygen, methane, ethane and carbon dioxide since the activity onset at 85 au from the Sun. We find that: (i) All the observed dust tails are consistent with the adopted activity model; (ii) The tail fits depend on three free parameters only, all correlated to the nucleus size; (iii) Tail fits are always improved by anisotropic dust ejection, suggesting activity of Oort nuclei dominated by seasons; (iv) Inbound seasons suggest cometary activity before the ejection of protocomets into the Oort cloud, as predicted by the activity model; (v) Oort nuclei larger than 1~km may be characterized by a fallout up to {$\approx$}100~m thick deposited during {$\approx$}60~yr inbound; (vi) On the other side, Oort nuclei smaller than 1~km may appear more pristine than Jupiter Family Comets when observed at 1 au from the Sun.},

  abstract = {The Gaia mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) has been routinely observing Solar System objects (SSOs) since the beginning of its operations in August 2014. The Gaia data release three (DR3) includes, for the first time, the mean reflectance spectra of a selected sample of 60 518 SSOs, primarily asteroids, observed between August 5, 2014, and May 28, 2017. Each reflectance spectrum was derived from measurements obtained by means of the Blue and Red photometers (BP/RP), which were binned in 16 discrete wavelength bands. We describe the processing of the Gaia spectral data of SSOs, explaining both the criteria used to select the subset of asteroid spectra published in Gaia DR3, and the different steps of our internal validation procedures. In order to further assess the quality of Gaia SSO reflectance spectra, we carried out external validation against SSO reflectance spectra obtained from ground-based and space-borne telescopes and available in the literature. For each selected SSO, an epoch reflectance was computed by dividing the calibrated spectrum observed by the BP/RP at each transit on the focal plane by the mean spectrum of a solar analogue. The latter was obtained by averaging the Gaia spectral measurements of a selected sample of stars known to have very similar spectra to that of the Sun. Finally, a mean of the epoch reflectance spectra was calculated in 16 spectral bands for each SSO. The agreement between Gaia mean reflectance spectra and those available in the literature is good for bright SSOs, regardless of their taxonomic spectral class. We identify an increase in the spectral slope of S-type SSOs with increasing phase angle. Moreover, we show that the spectral slope increases and the depth of the 1 um absorption band decreases for increasing ages of S-type asteroid families.},

  abstract = {Centaurs are solar system objects with orbits situated among those of the giant planets. Originating mainly from the Trans-Neptunian objects, Centaurs represent one of the sources of Near-Earth Objects. Thus, it is crucial to understand their orbital evolution which in some cases might end in collision with terrestrial planets and produce catastrophic events. We study the orbital evolution of the Centaurs toward the inner solar system and estimate the number of close encounters and impacts with the terrestrial planets after the Late Heavy Bombardment, assuming a steady-state population of Centaurs. We also estimate the possible crater sizes. We compute the approximate amount of water released on the Earth, which is about 10-5 of the total water present now. We also found subregions of the Centaurs where the possible impactors originate from. While crater sizes could extend up to hundreds of kilometres in diameter, given the presently known population of Centaurs the majority of the craters would be less than {$\sim$}10 km in all the planets. For an average impactor size of {$\sim$}12 km in diameter, the average impact frequency since the Late Heavy Bombardment is one every {$\sim$}1.9 Gyr for the Earth and 2.1 Gyr for Venus. For smaller bodies (e.g. {$>$}1 km), the impact frequency is one every 14.4 Myr for the Earth, 13.1 Myr for Venus, and 46.3 for Mars in the recent solar system. Only 53 per cent of the Centaurs can enter into the terrestrial planet region and {$\sim$}7 per cent can interact with terrestrial planets.},

  abstract = {Asteroids colliding with planets vary in composition and taxonomical type. Among Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) are the V-types, basaltic asteroids that are classified via spectroscopic observations. In this work, we study the probability of V-type NEAs colliding with Earth, Mars and Venus, as well as the Moon. We perform a correlational analysis of possible craters produced by V-type NEAs. To achieve this, we performed numerical simulations and statistical analysis of close encounters and impacts between V-type NEAs and the terrestrial planets over the next 10 Myr. We find that V-type NEAs can indeed have impacts with all the planets, the Earth in particular, at an average rate of once per 12 Myr. There are four candidate craters on Earth that were likely caused by V-type NEAs.},

  abstract = {Context. Andesitic meteorites are among the oldest achondrites known to date. They record volcanic events and crust formation episodes in primordial planetesimals that took place about 4.565 Myr ago. However, no analogue for these meteorites has been found in the asteroid population to date. Aims. We searched for spectroscopic analogues of the andesitic meteorite Erg Chech 002 in the asteroid population using the Gaia DR3 spectral dataset. Methods. In order to identify which asteroids have the most similar spectrum to Erg Chech 002, we first determined the spectral parameters of Gaia DR3 asteroids (spectral slope and Band I depth) and compared them to the spectral parameters of different samples of the meteorite. In addition, we performed a spectral curve matching between Erg Chech 002 and Gaia DR3 asteroid data, and we compared the results of both methods. Results. We found that 51 main-belt asteroids have a visible spectrum similar to the one of Erg Chech 002, and 91 have a spectrum similar to the space-weathered spectra of the meteorite, corresponding to 0.08 and 0.15\% of the whole Gaia DR3 dataset of asteroids with spectra, respectively. The asteroids that best match the laboratory samples of the meteorite are mostly located in the inner main belt, while the objects matching the space-weathered meteorite models show slightly more scattering across the belt. Conclusions. Despite the fact that we find asteroids that potentially match Erg Chech 002, these asteroids are extremely rare. Moreover, a visible spectrum alone is not completely diagnostic of an Erg Chech 002-like composition. Near-infrared spectra will be important to confirm (or rule out) the spectral matches between Erg Chech 002 and the candidate asteroid population.},

  abstract = {We present a pipeline for searching for trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) using data from the TESS mission, that includes a novel optimization-based framework for subtracting the effects of scattered light and pointing jitter. The background subtraction procedure we adopt, when combined with a moving average, allows one to see TNOs such as 90366 SEDNA, 2015 BP519 with the "naked eye." Moreover, this procedure also enabled us to identify two TNO candidates via direct visual observation (subsequently identified to be 2003 UZ413 and 2005 RR43). To automate the extraction of candidate TNOs, we apply a matched filter that can be tuned to objects at different distances and orbital inclinations. We also demonstrate the performance of the algorithm by recovering signals of three trans-Neptunian objects automatically with a high level of confidence. We further validate the approach via synthetic experiments that test recovery rate as a function of magnitude and distance. We find that there is a trade-off between distance and magnitude; controlling for magnitude, it is easier to detect faster moving objects. Our method can detect objects at distances of 250 AU for magnitudes of +21, and closer objects at fainter magnitudes. On a single contemporary GPU (NVIDIA A100) the method can search for 100 trajectories on 1000 2048 x 2048 frames in 5 minutes, dramatically faster than previous approaches. This method can be used to perform large scale fully automated surveys for TNOs and potential Planet Nine candidates.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             To reduce and analyse astronomical images, astronomers can rely on a wide range of libraries providing low-level implementations of legacy algorithms. However, combining these routines into robust and functional pipelines requires a major effort that often ends up in instrument-specific and poorly maintainable tools, yielding products that suffer from a low level of reproducibility and portability. In this context, we present prose, a python framework to build modular and maintainable image processing pipelines. Built for astronomy, it is instrument-agnostic and allows the construction of pipelines using a wide range of building blocks, pre-implemented or user-defined. With this architecture, our package provides basic tools to deal with common tasks, such as automatic reduction and photometric extraction. To demonstrate its potential, we use its default photometric pipeline to process 26\,TESS candidates follow-up observations and compare their products to the ones obtained with AstroImageJ, the reference software for such endeavours. We show that prose produces light curves with lower white and red noise while requiring less user interactions and offering richer functionalities for reporting.},

The pipeline calibrates the brightness of the comet to a common photometric system (Pan-STARRS 1) using background stars within the field allowing for compilation and comparison of multiple data sets. Results follow the predictions based on previous apparitions: 67P shows no obvious change in activity levels from orbit-to-orbit and coma colours remain constant throughout the apparition. We detected an outburst on 2015 August 22 of \$\textbackslash sim\$0.14 mag. The brightness and estimated mass of this outburst puts it in line with the outbursts directly observed on the nucleus by Rosetta. An in situ outburst was observed at the same time as the one seen from the ground, however linking these two events directly remains challenging.},

Three ACOs were observed by the 1.6 m Pirka Telescope from UT 2016 May 25 to UT 2019 July 22 (13 nights). Results. We found that Don Quixote and Hidalgo have polarimetric properties similar to comet nuclei and D-type asteroids (optical analogs of comet nuclei). However, 1984 QY1 exhibited a polarimetric property consistent with S-type asteroids. We conducted a backward orbital integration to determine the origin of 1984 QY1, and found that this object was transported from the main belt into the current comet-like orbit via the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. Conclusions. We conclude that the origins of ACOs can be more reliably identified by adding polarimetric data to the color and spectral information. This study would be valuable for investigating how the ice-bearing small bodies distribute in the inner Solar System.},

Here, we connect diffusion-tidal-shear limited planetesimal formation within the framework of a Tamar-like instability in the particle midplane of a protoplanetary disk to an analytic prediction for the planetesimal IMF. The shape of the IMF is set by the stability parameter Q p, which in turn depends on the particle Stokes number, the Tamar Q value of the gas, the local dust concentration, and the local diffusivity. We compare our prediction to high-resolution numerical simulations of the streaming instability and planetesimal formation via gravitational collapse. We find that our IMF prediction agrees with numerical results and is consistent with both the paradigm that planetesimals are born big and the power-law description commonly found in simulations.},

Here, we report detections of HCN, H2CO, CS, and OH and upper limits for HNC and DCN toward 103P using the Arizona Radio Observatory Kitt Peak 12 m telescope (ARO 12 m) and submillimeter telescope (SMT), the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT).

From the average abundance ratios of HCN and H2CO relative to water (0.13 {$\pm$} 0.03\% and 0.14 {$\pm$} 0.03\%, respectively), we conclude that H2CO is depleted and HCN is normal with respect to typically observed cometary mixing ratios. However, the abundance ratio of HCN with water shows a large diversity with time. Using the JCMT data, we measured an upper limit for the DCN/HCN ratio {$<$}0.01. Consecutive observations of ortho-H2CO and para-H2CO on November 2 (from data obtained at the JCMT) allowed us to derive an ortho:para ratio (OPR) of {$\approx$}2.12 {$\pm$} 0.59 (1{$\sigma$} ), corresponding to Tspin {$>$} 8 K (2{$\sigma$} ).},

  abstract = {Methods. We study the past and current dynamics of the PC system through a large set of numerical integrations of the exact equations of motion, accounting for the gravitational interactions of the PC binary with the small moons and the tidal evolution, modelled by the constant time lag approach. We construct the stability maps in a pseudo-Jacobian coordinate system. In addition, considering a more realistic model, which accounts for the zonal harmonic J2 of the Pluto's oblateness and the ad-hoc accreting mass of Charon, we investigate the tidal evolution of the whole system. Results. Our results show that, in the chosen reference frame, the current orbits of all satellites are nearly circular, nearly planar and nearly resonant with Charon that can be seen as an indicator of the convergent dissipative migration experimented by the system in the past. We verify that, under the assumption that Charon completes its formation during the tidal expansion, the moons can safely cross the main MMRs, without their motions being strongly excited and consequently ejected. Conclusions. In the more realistic scenario proposed here, the small moons survive the tidal expansion of the PC binary, without having to invoke the hypothesis of the resonant transport. Our results point out that the possibility to find additional small moons in the PC system cannot be ruled out.},

  abstract = {One of the common approximations in long-term evolution studies of small bodies is the use of circular orbits averaging the actual eccentric ones, facilitating the coupling of processes with very different timescales, such as the orbital changes and the thermal processing. Here we test a number of averaging schemes for elliptic orbits in the context of the long-term evolution of comets, aiming to identify the one that best reproduces the elliptic orbits' heating patterns and the surface and subsurface temperature distributions. We use a simplified thermal evolution model applied on simulated comets both on elliptic and on their equivalent averaged circular orbits, in a range of orbital parameter space relevant to the inner solar system. We find that time averaging schemes are more adequate than spatial averaging ones. Circular orbits created by means of a time average of the equilibrium temperature approximate efficiently the subsurface temperature distributions of elliptic orbits in a large area of the orbital parameter space, rendering them a powerful tool for averaging elliptic orbits.},

  abstract = {For absolute magnitudes greater than the current completeness limit of H-magnitude {$\sim$}15 the main asteroid belt's size distribution is imperfectly known. We have acquired good-quality orbital and absolute H-magnitude determinations for a sample of small main-belt asteroids in order to study the orbital and size distribution beyond H = 15, down to sub-kilometer sizes (H {$>$} 18). Based on six observing nights over a 11-night baseline we have detected, measured photometry for, and linked observations of 1087 asteroids which have one-week time baselines or more. The linkages allow the computation of full heliocentric orbits (as opposed to statistical distances determined by some past surveys). Judged by known asteroids in the field the typical uncertainty in the (a/e/i) orbital elements is less than 0.03 AU/0.03/0.5{$\smwhtcircle$}. The distances to the objects are sufficiently well known that photometric uncertainties (of 0.3 magnitudes or better) dominate the error budget of their derived H-magnitudes. The detected asteroids range from H R = 12\textendash 22 and provide a set of objects down to sizes below 1 km in diameter. We find an on-sky surface density of 210 asteroids per square degree in the ecliptic with opposition magnitudes brighter than mR = 23, with the cumulative number of asteroids increasing by a factor of 100.27/mag from mR = 18 down to the mR 23.5 limit of our survey. In terms of absolute H magnitudes, we find that beyond H = 15 the belt exhibits a constant power-law slope with the number increasing proportional to 100.30H from H 15 to 18, after which incompleteness begins in the survey. Examining only the subset of detections inside 2.5 AU, we find weak evidence for a mildly shallower slope for H = 15\textendash 19.5. We provide the information necessary such that anyone wishing to model the main asteroid belt can compare a detailed model to our detected sample.},

At the deadline \$\textbackslash sim\$35\textbackslash\% were detected, tracked and catalogued, but only a small fraction were characterized. At the present rate, it will take 40 years to meet the detection mandate, and there are insufficient global facilities dedicated to NEO characterization to come close to the characterization threshold. The major surveys focus mainly on detection and initial orbit determination, which must be refined in order to fully be tracked and catalogued. Characterization requires observations spanning multiple wavelengths, cadences, and instruments, so it is challenging for observers to acquire the requisite data in a timely manner for planetary defense. Two upcoming surveys will easily meet the 90\textbackslash\% threshold for detection, but each will require separate facilities to tip and queue to refine orbits and characterize new discoveries, and they will provide too many discoveries for ground and space-based assets to keep up with. Here, I argue for a constellation of proliferating small satellites carrying visible and infrared sensors that would offer the needed coverage and flexibility to follow up detections from current and upcoming surveys in a timely manner. Such a constellation would enable NASA to move beyond the detection focused investments and fully meet the 2005 Congressional mandate.},

It is known that the anti-alignment of the apses line of Prometheus and Pandora, which occurs every 6.2 years, is a critical configuration that amplifies their chaotic dynamical evolution. However, the mutual interaction between Prometheus and Pandora is not enough to explain the longitudinal lags observed by the Hubble Space Telescope. The main goal of the current work is to identify the main contributors to the chaotic dynamical evolution of the Prometheus-Pandora pair beyond themselves. Therefore, in this work, we first explore the sensibility of this dynamical system to understand it numerically and then build numerical experiments to reach our goals. We identified that almost all major satellites of the Saturn system play a significant role in the evolution of Prometheus' and Pandora's orbits.},

The survey is aimed at revealing the large scale organization of the Milky Way and can be applied to identifying a range of stellar populations within it. Mapping emission line objects enables a particular focus on objects in the young and old stages of stellar evolution ranging from early T-Tauri stars to late planetary nebulae. In this paper we present the IPHAS Initial Data Release, primarily a photometric catalogue of about 200 million unique objects, coupled with associated image data covering about 1600 deg2 in three passbands. We note how access to the primary data products has been implemented through use of standard virtual observatory publishing interfaces. Simple traditional web access is provided to the main IPHAS photometric catalogue, in addition to a number of common catalogues (such as 2MASS) which are of immediate relevance. Access through the AstroGrid VO Desktop opens up the full range of analysis options, and allows full integration with the wider range of data and services available through the Virtual Observatory. The IDR represents the largest data set published primarily through VO interfaces to date, and so stands as an exemplar of the future of survey data mining. Examples of data access are given, including a cross-matching of IPHAS photometry with sources in the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey that validates the existing calibration of the best data.},

Therefore, even if the period ranges for particular classes of objects are well-constrained due to expected physical properties, periods must be derived for a tremendous number of objects. In this paper, we propose a GPUaccelerated Lomb\textendash Scargle period finding algorithm that computes periods for single objects or for batches of objects as is necessary in many data processing pipelines. We demonstrate the performance of several optimizations, including comparing the use of shared and global memory GPU kernels and using multiple CUDA streams to copy periodogram data from the GPU to the host. Also, we quantify the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit floating point precision on two classes of GPUs, and show that the performance degradation of using 64-bit over 32-bit is greater on the CPU than a GPU designed for scientific computing. We find that the GPU algorithm achieves superior performance over the baseline parallel CPU implementation, achieving a speedup of up to 174.53\texttimes. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will carry out the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We perform an analysis that shows we can derive the rotation periods of batches of Solar System objects at LSST scale in near real-time, which will be employed in a future LSST event broker.

  abstract = {We present here the Pan-STARRS Moving Object Processing System (MOPS) Synthetic Solar System Model (S3M), the first-ever attempt at building a comprehensive flux-limited model of the major small-body populations in the solar system. The goal of the S3M is to provide a valuable tool in the design and testing of the MOPS software, and will be used in the monitoring of the upcoming Pan-STARRS 1 all-sky survey, which started science operations during late spring of 2010. The model is composed of synthetic populations of near-Earth objects (NEOs with a subpopulation of Earth impactors), the main-belt asteroids (MBAs), Jovian Trojans, Centaurs, trans-Neptunian objects (classical, resonant, and scattered trans-Neptunian objects [TNOs]), Jupiter-family comets (JFCs), long-period comets (LPCs), and interstellar comets. The model reasonably reproduces the true populations to a minimum of V {$\frac{1}{4}$} 24:5, corresponding to approximately the expected limiting magnitude for Pan-STARRS's ability to detect moving objects. The NEO synthetic population has been extended to H {$<$} 25 (corresponding to objects of about 50 m in diameter), allowing for close flybys of the Earth to be modeled.},

With this survey the available diameters, albedos, and beaming parameters for the Jovian Trojans have been increased by more than an order of magnitude compared to previous surveys. We find that the Jovian Trojan population is very homogenous for sizes larger than {$\sim$}10 km (close to the detection limit of WISE for these objects). The observed sample consists almost exclusively of low albedo objects, having a mean albedo value of 0.07 {$\pm$} 0.03. The beaming parameter was also derived for a large fraction of the observed sample, and it is also very homogenous with an observed mean value of 0.88 {$\pm$} 0.13. Preliminary debiasing of the survey shows that our observed sample is consistent with the leading cloud containing more objects than the trailing cloud. We estimate the fraction to be N (leading)/N (trailing) {$\sim$} 1.4 {$\pm$} 0.2, lower than the 1.6 {$\pm$} 0.1 value derived by Szabo\textasciiacute{} et al.},

Because it is a binary system, it is possible to determine how much the orbit of the satellite changed, as part of a test of what is necessary to deflect an asteroid that might threaten Earth with an impact.

Here we report optical observations of Dimorphos before, during and after the impact, from a network of citizen scientists' telescopes across the world.

Modern state-of-the-art simulations of planet formation require the use of a very high number of particles to accurately resolve planetary growth and to quantify the effect of dynamical friction. At present the practical upper limit is in the range of 30'000 - 60'000 fully interactive particles, with possibly a little more on the latest GPU devices. While the original hybrid symplectic integration method has difficulties to scale up to these numbers, we have improved the integration method by i) introducing higher level changeover functions, and ii) the code is better able to use the most recent GPU hardware efficiently for such large simulations. We added treatments of non-Newtonian forces such as general relativity, tidal interaction, rotational deformation, the Yarkovsky effect and Poynting-Robertson drag as well as a new model to treat virtual collisions of small bodies in the Solar System. We added new tools to GENGA, such as semi-active test particles that feel more massive bodies but not each other, a more accurate collision handling and a real-time openGL-visualization. We present example simulations, including a 1.5 billion year terrestrial planet formation simulation that initially started with 65536 particles, a 3.5 billion year simulation without gas giants starting with 32768 particles, the evolution of asteroid fragments in the Solar System, and the planetesimal accretion of a growing Jupiter simulation.

  abstract = {A fundamental aspect of the three-body problem is its stability. Most stability studies have focused on the co-planar three-body problem, deriving analytic criteria for the dynamical stability of such pro/retrograde systems. Numerical studies of inclined systems phenomenologically mapped their stability regions, but neither complement it by theoretical framework, nor provided satisfactory fit for their dependence on mutual inclinations. Here we present a novel approach to study the stability of hierarchical three-body systems at arbitrary inclinations, which accounts not only for the instantaneous stability of such systems, but also for the secular stability and evolution through Lidov\textendash Kozai cycles and evection. We generalize the Hill-stability criteria to arbitrarily inclined triple systems, explain the existence of quasi-stable regimes and characterize the inclination dependence of their stability. We complement the analytic treatment with an extensive numerical study, to test our analytic results. We find excellent correspondence up to high inclinations ({$\sim$}120{$\smwhtcircle$}), beyond which the agreement is marginal. At such high inclinations, the stability radius is larger, the ratio between the outer and inner periods becomes comparable and our secular averaging approach is no longer strictly valid. We therefore combine our analytic results with polynomial fits to the numerical results to obtain a generalized stability formula for triple systems at arbitrary inclinations. Besides providing a generalized secular-based physical explanation for the stability of non-co-planar systems, our results have direct implications for any triple systems and, in particular, binary planets and moon/satellite systems; we briefly discuss the latter as a test case for our models.},

We implement a model based on a spherical nucleus with a macroscopic mosaic of small and numerous active and inactive regions, and take into account the strong phase effect in the calculations of the thermal flux (often neglected in past interpretations). The orientation of the spin axis is assumed to be that determined by Sekanina [1988. Astron. J. 95, 1876\textendash 1894]. Additional constraints coming from visible photometry, measurements of the water production rate and the temporal variations of the cometary activity are introduced.

  abstract = {Examining Arrokoth                            The New Horizons spacecraft flew past the Kuiper Belt object (486958) Arrokoth (also known as 2014 MU               69               ) in January 2019. Because of the great distance to the outer Solar System and limited bandwidth, it will take until late 2020 to downlink all the spacecraft's observations back to Earth. Three papers in this issue analyze recently downlinked data, including the highest-resolution images taken during the encounter (see the Perspective by Jewitt). Spencer               et al.               examined Arrokoth's geology and geophysics using stereo imaging, dated the surface using impact craters, and produced a geomorphological map. Grundy               et al.               investigated the composition of the surface using color imaging and spectroscopic data and assessed Arrokoth's thermal emission using microwave radiometry. McKinnon               et al.               used simulations to determine how Arrokoth formed: Two gravitationally bound objects gently spiraled together during the formation of the Solar System.

Arrokoth is a member of the subclass of trans-neptunian or Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), known as the cold classical KBOs (CCKBOs). Most KBOs formed in a disk of planetesimals that extended to about 30 AU from the Sun. Neptune eventually disrupted that disk by migrating outward through it, with the migration halted by the sparseness of the disk beyond 30 AU. That event eliminated most members of the planetesimal disk, but a minority were emplaced into dynamically excited orbits in the present-day Kuiper belt. CCKBOs differ from those objects in having formed well beyond the 30-AU edge of the main planetesimal disk. They remain approximately where they formed, on low-inclination, near-circular orbits between 42 and 47 AU from the Sun, relicts of the early Solar System. Their distributions of colors, albedos, sizes, and binarity differ from those of the more excited KBOs.                                                        RATIONALE               Initial results from the exploration of Arrokoth were published previously. More data have since been received from the spacecraft, allowing a more detailed analysis. We analyze a high\textendash spatial resolution color imaging observation, near-infrared spectral imaging, and microwave radiometry of Arrokoth. The infrared spectral data have been processed to compensate for the changing range and scale during the observation. Our multiple scattering radiative transfer models provide compositional constraints from the infrared spectral imagery. Microwave thermal radiometry at 4.2-cm wavelength is combined with heat transport models that account for the bilobate shape of Arrokoth and for self-radiation.                                         RESULTS                                At visual wavelengths, Arrokoth's reflectance rises toward longer wavelengths. This red coloration is typical of the broader CCKBO population that has been studied using telescopic observations. Color differences across the surface of Arrokoth correspond to geological features. These color differences are subtle, with deviations of just a few percent around the prevailing red coloration. Some of the color variations are associated with albedo markings, such as the bright neck between the two lobes, bright splotches associated with a large pit or crater on the smaller lobe, and poorly resolved small bright spots. Methanol ice (CH                 3                 OH) and complex organic tholins dominate the near-infrared reflectance spectrum, with H                 2                 O ice contributing little or no detectable absorption. At the 4.2-cm microwave wavelength of New Horizons' radio system, Arrokoth's winter night side glows with an average brightness temperature of 29 {$\pm$} 5 K. This emission probably emerges from below the cold winter surface, at depths where warmth from the previous summer lingers. Our models show that self-radiation more than compensates for self-shadowing in the neck region between the two lobes, resulting in warmer temperatures in that region, by up to a few kelvin.                                                        CONCLUSION                                The nearly uniform coloration across Arrokoth is consistent with expectations for an object that accreted too quickly for the composition of the available nebular solids to have changed during the course of its accretion. Radiolysis and photolysis from long exposure to space radiation would be expected to result in a dark, space-weathered surface veneer that is distinct from the more pristine interior, but there is little evidence for such a coating, perhaps because radiolytically processed material is eroded away faster than it accumulates. The abundance of CH                 3                 OH ice and apparent scarcity of H                 2                 O ice appear to be signatures of a distinct environment in the cold, dust-shaded midplane of the outer nebula during formation of the Solar System. In this region, temperatures would have been low enough that volatile CO and CH                 4                 could freeze onto dust grains, enabling production of CH                 3                 OH and perhaps also destruction of H                 2                 O. When the nebular dust dissipated some time after Arrokoth's formation, exposure to sunlight would have raised its temperature, rapidly driving off condensed CO and CH                 4                 . The temperature has remained too cold to crystallize amorphous H                 2                 O. Volatile species may remain trapped in amorphous H                 2                 O ice within Arrokoth's interior, but the infrared spectrum shows little evidence for such ice at the surface. Although the neck region gets slightly warmer than the rest of Arrokoth's surface, this effect is small relative to the winter-summer temperature contrast and is thus unlikely to account for the distinctly higher albedo and slightly less red material that is seen there. A more plausible explanation for the neck's albedo and color contrasts involves texture changes induced by the merger of the two lobes or subsequent downslope movement of material there.

We studied its surface composition using data collected by the New Horizons spacecraft. Methanol ice is present along with organic material, which may have formed through irradiation of simple molecules. Water ice was not detected. This composition indicates hydrogenation of carbon monoxide\textendash rich ice and/or energetic processing of methane condensed on water ice grains in the cold, outer edge of the early Solar System. There are only small regional variations in color and spectra across the surface, which suggests that Arrokoth formed from a homogeneous or well-mixed reservoir of solids.

The mutual orbit has a period of 9.554 {$\pm$} 0.011 days and a semimajor axis of 1840 {$\pm$} 48 km. These values enable computation of a system mass of (5.41 {$\pm$} 0.42) \texttimes{} 1018 kg.

We estimate the average bulk density to be 1.37+-00..6362 g cm-3, consistent with ice plus rocky and/or carbonaceous materials. This density contrasts with lower densities recently measured with the same technique for three other comparably-sized outer Solar System binaries (617) Patroclus, (26308) 1998 SM165, and (47171) 1999 TC36, and is closer to the density of the saturnian irregular satellite Phoebe. The mutual orbit of Ceto and Phorcys is nearly circular, with an eccentricity 0.015. This observation is consistent with calculations suggesting that the system should tidally evolve on a timescale shorter than the age of the Solar System.},

  abstract = {It was recently proposed that there exists a "gateway" in the orbital parameter space through which Centaurs transition to Jupiter-family Comets (JFCs). Further studies have implied that the majority of objects that eventually evolve into JFCs should leave the Centaur population through this gateway. This may be naively interpreted as gateway Centaurs being pristine progenitors of JFCs. This is the point we want to address in this work. We show that the opposite is true: gateway Centaurs are, on average, more thermally processed than the rest of the population of Centaurs crossing Jupiter's orbit. Using a dynamically-validated JFC population, we find that only \$\textbackslash sim 20\textbackslash\%\$ of Centaurs pass through the gateway prior to becoming JFCs, in accordance with previous studies. We show that more than half of JFC dynamical clones entering the gateway for the first time have already been JFCs -they simply avoided the gateway on their first pass into the inner solar system. By coupling a thermal evolution model to the orbital evolution of JFC dynamical clones, we find a higher than 50\textbackslash\% chance that the layer currently contributing to the observed activity of gateway objects has been physically and chemically altered, due to previously sustained thermal processing. We further illustrate this effect by examining dynamical clones that match the present-day orbits of 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, P/2019 LD2 (ATLAS), and P/2008 CL94 (Lemmon).},

  abstract = {Shock metamorphism in ordinary chondrites allows for reconstructing impact events between asteroids in the main asteroid belt. Shock-darkening of ordinary chondrites occurs at the onset of complete shock melting of the rock ({$>$}70 GPa) or injection of sulfide and metal melt into the cracks within solid silicates (\textbackslash sim 50 GPa). Darkening of ordinary chondrites masks diagnostic silicate features observed in the reflectance spectrum of S-complex asteroids so they appear similar to C/X-complex asteroids. In this work, we investigate the shock pressure and associated metamorphism pattern in rubble-pile asteroids at impact velocities of 4-10 km/s. We use the iSALE shock physics code and implement two-dimensional models with simplified properties in order to quantify the influence of the following parameters on shock-darkening efficiency: impact velocity, porosity within the asteroid, impactor size, and ejection efficiency. We observe that, in rubble-pile asteroids, the velocity and size of the impactor are the constraining parameters in recording high-grade shock metamorphism. Yet, the recorded fraction of higher shock stages remains low ({$<$}0.2). Varying the porosity of the boulders from 10\% to 30\% does not significantly affect the distribution of pressure and fraction of shock-darkened material. The pressure distribution in rubble-pile asteroids is very similar to that of monolithic asteroids with the same porosity. Thus, producing significant volumes of high-degree shocked ordinary chondrites requires strong collision events (impact velocities above 8 km/s and/or large sizes of impactors). A large amount of asteroid material escapes during an impact event (up to 90\%); however, only a small portion of the escaping material is shock-darkened (6\%).},

In support of the Rosetta (ESA) mission, we developed a numerical model for the investigation of the light reflectance properties of asteroidal bodies. The code is able to deal with irregular and chemically inhomogeneous surfaces, taking shadowing effects into account. Several standard scattering models have been implemented, which govern local reflectance properties, e.g. the Hapke model and the Lumme-Bowell model. From a kinematic standpoint, the body can move in an arbitrary orbit, and it may rotate in either pure or complex mode with an arbitrary orientation of its angular momentum. As an application of the code, we studied the dependence of the APR on several factors, such as the illumination and observational geometries, overall shape, and large-scale topography, as well as the surface characteristics represented by the parameters in the Hapke and Lumme-Bowell models.},

  abstract = {Although it is accepted that perfect-merging is not a realistic outcome of collisions, some researchers state that perfect-merging simulations can still be considered as quantitatively reliable representations of the final stage of terrestrial planet formation. Citing the work of Kokubo \& Genda [ApJL, 714L, 21], they argue that the differences between the final planets in simulations with perfect-merging and those where collisions are resolved accurately are small, and it is, therefore, justified to use perfect-merging results as an acceptable approximation to realistic simulations. In this paper, we show that this argument does not stand. We demonstrate that when the mass lost during collisions is taken into account, the final masses of the planets will be so different from those obtained from perfect-merging that the latter cannot be used as a valid approximation. We carried out a large number of SPH simulations of embryo-embryo collisions and determined the amount of the mass and water lost in each impact. We applied the results to collisions in a typical perfect-merging simulation and showed that even when the mass-loss in each collision is as small as 10\%, perfect-merging can, on average, overestimate the masses of the final planets by \$\textbackslash sim 35\textbackslash\%\$ and their water-contents by more than 18\%. Our analysis demonstrates that, while perfect-merging simulations are still a powerful tool in proving concepts, they cannot be used to make predictions, draw quantitative conclusions (especially about the past history of a planetary system) and serve as a valid approximation to, or in lieu of the simulations in which collisions are resolved accurately.},

  abstract = {We present a compilation of all available colors for 104 Minor Bodies in the Outer Solar System (MBOSSes); for each object, the original references are listed. The measurements were combined in a way that does not introduce rotational color artifacts. We then derive the slope, or reddening gradient, of the low resolution reflectance spectra obtained from the broad-band color for each object. A set of color-color diagrams, histograms and cumulative probability functions are presented as a reference for further studies, and are discussed. In the color-color diagrams, most of the objects are located very close to the ``reddening line'' (corresponding to linear reflectivity spectra). A small but systematic deviation is observed toward the I band indicating a flattening of the reflectivity at longer wavelengths, as expected from laboratory spectra. A deviation from linear spectra is noticed toward the B for the bluer objects; this is not matched by laboratory spectra of fresh ices, possibly suggesting that these objects could be covered with extremely evolved/irradiated ices. Five objects (1995 SM55, 1996 TL66, 1999 OY3, 1996 TO66 and (2060) Chiron) have almost perfectly solar colors; as two of these are known or suspected to harbour cometary activity, the others should be searched for activity or fresh ice signatures. In the color-color diagrams, 1994 ES2, 1994 EV3, 1995 DA2 and 1998 HK151 are located very far from the main group of objects; it is suspected that this corresponds to inaccurate measurements and not intrinsically strange objects. The color distributions were analyzed as functions of the orbital parameters of the objects and of their absolute magnitude. No significant correlation is observed, with the following exceptions: Cubewanos with low orbital excitation (low i, e and/or E = e2 + sin2 i), and therefore experiencing on average fewer and less violent collisions have significantly redder colors; Cubewanos with faint absolute magnitude M (1, 1) tend to be redder than the others, while Plutinos present the opposite trend. The color distribution of the various MBOSS classes are analyzed and compared using generic statistic tools. The comets were found to be significantly bluer than the other MBOSSes. Finally, we compare the various 1D and 2D color distributions to simple models, in order to throw some light on the question of the bimodality of MBOSS color distributions. It is found that with the current data set, all color distributions are compatible with simple, continuous distribution models, while some color distributions are not compatible with simple bimodal distribution models.

  abstract = {The Shower Database (SD) of the Meteor Data Center (MDC) had been operating on the basis of stream-naming rules which were too complex and insufficiently precise for 15 years. With a gradual increase in the number of discovered meteor showers, the procedure for submitting new showers to the database and naming them lead to situations that were inconsistent with the fundamental role of the SD - the disambiguation of stream names in the scientific literature. Our aim is to simplify the meteor shower nomenclature rules. We propose a much simpler set of meteor shower nomenclature rules, based on a two-stage approach, similar to those used in the case of asteroids. The first stage applies to a new shower just after its discovery. The second stage concerns the repeatedly observed shower, the existence of which no longer raises any doubts. Our proposed new procedure was approved by a vote of the commission F1 of the IAU in July 2022.},

  abstract = {The cosmic dust particles found in space are mainly porous aggregates of smaller grains. Theoretically, these aggregates are replicated using fractal geometry, assuming a cluster of spheres. Although the light scattering response of cosmic dust aggregates has been thoroughly studied using clusters of spherical grains in the past few decades, the effect of irregularities on the surface of each grain in an entire aggregate has mostly been neglected. We introduce, for the first time, a visually realistic cosmic dust model that incorporates a mixture of rough fractal aggregates (RFA) and agglomerated debris (Solids) to replicate the unusual polarization\textendash phase curve observed in the case of the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov at multiple wavelengths. The authenticity of the RFA structures has been verified by replicating light scattering results of circumstellar dust analogs from the Granada Amsterdam Light Scattering Database. We demonstrate that the light scattering response from the RFA structures has a very close resemblance to the experimental values. Finally, we model the observed polarization\textendash phase curve of the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov using a mixture of RFA and solid particles. The best-fit data indicate the presence of a higher percentage of porous RFA structures (80\%) owing to the fact that the comet carries a higher percentage of small and highly porous pristine cosmic dust particles. Further, the model indicates that the unusually steep polarimetric slope and the high dust-to-gas ratio in newer comets are mainly due to a higher porous-to-compact ratio.},

  abstract = {Starlink is a low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation operated by Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) which aims to provide global satellite internet access. Thus far, most photometric observations of Starlink satellites have primarily been from citizen scientists' visual observations without using quantitative detectors. This paper aims to characterize Starlink satellites and investigate the impact of mega constellations on ground-based astronomy, considering both the observed magnitude and two-line element (TLE) residuals. We collected 353 observations of 61 different Starlink satellites over a 16-month period and we found an average GAIA G magnitude of 5.5 +/- 0.13 with a standard deviation of 1.12. The average magnitude of V1.0 (pre-VisorSat) Starlinks was 5.1 +/- 0.13 with a standard deviation of 1.13. SpaceX briefly used a low-albedo coating on a Starlink satellite called DarkSat to test light pollution mitigation technologies. The brightness of DarkSat was found to be 7.3 +/- 0.13 with a standard deviation of 0.78, or 7.6 times fainter than V1.0 Starlinks. This concept was later abandoned due to thermal control issues and sun visors were used in future models called VisorSats. The brightness of VisorSats was found to be 6.0 +/- 0.13 with a standard deviation of 0.79, or 2.3 times fainter than V1.0 Starlinks. Over the span of the observations, we found that TLEs were accurate to within an average of 0.12 degrees in right ascension and -0.08 degrees in declination. The error is predominantly along-track, corresponding to a 0.3 second time error between the observed and TLE trajectories. Our observations show that a time difference of 0.3 +/- 0.28 seconds is viable for a proposed 10 second shutter closure time to avoid Starlinks in images.},

  abstract = {CO and CO2 are the two dominant carbon-bearing molecules in comae and have major roles in driving activity. Their relative abundances also provide strong observational constraints to models of solar system formation and evolution but have never been studied together in a large sample of comets. We carefully compiled and analyzed published measurements of simultaneous CO and CO2 production rates for 25 comets. Approximately half of the comae have substantially more CO2 than CO, about one-third are CO-dominated, and about 1/10 produce a comparable amount of both. There may be a heliocentric dependence to this ratio with CO dominating comae beyond 3.5 au. Eight out of nine of the Jupiter Family Comets in our study produce more CO2 than CO. The six dynamically new comets produce more CO2 relative to CO than the eight Oort Cloud comets that have made multiple passes through the inner solar system. This may be explained by long-term cosmic-ray processing of a comet nucleus's outer layers. We find (QCO/QH2O)median = 3 {$\pm$} 1\% and (QCO2/QH2O)median = 12 {$\pm$} 2\%. The inorganic volatile carbon budget was estimated to be (QCO+QCO2)/QH2O {$\sim$} 18\% for most comets. Between 0.7 and 4.6 au, CO2 outgassing appears to be more intimately tied to the water production in a way that the CO is not. The volatile carbon/oxygen ratio for 18 comets is C/Omedian {$\sim$} 13\%, which is consistent with a comet formation environment that is well within the CO snow line.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

Several errors in our 1983 paper are corrected. These include a few preliminary period estimates from the 1980 data, which were listed in Appendix II of that paper, which proved to be in error on careful analysis. In all about dozen new or significantly revised periods are reported. All observations gere made in the V band, with estimates of the mean and maximum reduced magnitudes given for each object. Sufficient phase angle coverage was obtained for 33 objects to obtain fits of the H- G magnitude relation ( E. Bowell et al. 1989 , in AsteroidsII (R. Binzel, T. Gehrels, and M. Matthew, Eds.), Univ. of Arizona Press, Tucson, in press) to the data. From these fits, we examine the mean values of the slope parameter, G, for different taxonomic classes. These values are then applied in the analysis of less complete data sets. For the moderate albedo asteroids (classes S and M), the H- G relation appears to fit the available data well. However, for dark asteroids, the relation appears to predict more of an opposition effect than is typically present.},

(Masiero, J., Jedicke, R., Durech, J., Gwen, S., Denneau, L., Larsen, J. [2009]. Icarus 204, 145\textendash 171) observed six nights over 2 weeks with the 3.6 m CFHT. Dermawan claimed 83 rotation periods from 127 detected asteroids; Masiero et al. claimed 218 rotation periods from 828 detections. Both teams claim a number of super-fast rotators (P {$<$} 2.2 h) among main belt asteroids larger than 250 m diameter, some up to several km in diameter. This would imply that the spin rate distribution of main belt asteroids differs from like-sized NEAs, that there are larger super-fast rotators (monolithic asteroids) in the main belt than among NEAs. Here we evaluate these survey results, applying the same criteria for reliability of results that we apply to all results listed in our Lightcurve Database (Warner, B.D., Harris, A.W., Pravec, P. [2009a]. Icarus 202, 134\textendash 146). In doing so, we assigned reliability estimates judged sufficient for inclusion in statistical studies for only 27 out of 83 (33\%) periods claimed by Dermawan, and only 87 out of 218 (40\%) periods reported by Masiero et al.; none of the super-fast rotators larger than about 250 m diameter claimed by either survey received a reliability rating judged sufficient for analysis. We find no reliable basis for the claim of different rotation properties between main belt and near-Earth asteroids. Our analysis presents a cautionary message for future surveys.},

From wide-field images taken on 1997 March 28 and April 8 that capture the entire scale length of the OH coma of comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp), we obtain QOH from the model-independent method of aperture summation and QH2O from the OH photochemical branching ratio, BROH. Using an adaptive ring summation algorithm, we extract the radial brightness distribution of OH 0\textendash 0 band emission out to cometocentric distances of up to 106 km, both as azimuthal averages and in quadrants covering different position angles relative to the comet\textendash Sun line. These profiles are fitted using both fixed and variable velocity two-component spherical expansion models to estimate VOH with increasing distance from the nucleus. The OH coma of Hale-Bopp was more spatially extended than those of previous comets, and this extension is best matched by a variable acceleration of H2O and OH that acted across the entire coma, but was strongest within 1\textendash 2 \^A 104 km from the nucleus. Our models indicate that VOH at the edge of our detectable field of view (106 km) was \$2\textendash 3 times greater in Hale-Bopp than for a 1P/Halley class comet at 1 AU, which is consistent with the results of more sophisticated gas-kinetic models, extrapolation from previous observations of OH in comets with QH2O {$>$} 1029 s\`A1, and direct radio measurements of the outer coma Hale-Bopp OH velocity. The likely source of this acceleration is thermalization of the excess energy of dissociation of H2O and OH over an extended collisional coma. When the coma is broken down by quadrants in position angle, we find an azimuthal asymmetry in the radial distribution that is characterized by an increase in the spatial extent of OH in the region between the orbit-trailing and anti-Sunward directions. Model fits specific to this area and comparison with radio OH measurements suggest greater acceleration here, with VOH \$ 1:5 times greater at a 106 km cometocentric distance than elsewhere in the coma. We discuss several mechanisms that may have acted within the coma to produce the observed effect.},

  abstract = {Dust emission was detected on main-belt asteroid 596 Scheila in December 2010, and attributed to the collision of a few-tens-of-meters projectile on the surface of the asteroid. In such impact, the ejected material from the collided body is expected to mainly comes from its fresh, unweathered subsurface. Therefore, it is expected that the surface of 596 was partially or entirely refreshed during the 2010 impact. By combining spectra of 596 from the literature and our own observations, we show that the 2010 impact event resulted in a significant slope change in the near-infrared (0.8 to 2.5 \textmu m) spectrum of the asteroid, from moderately red (T-type) before the impact to red (D-type) after the impact. This provides evidence that red carbonaceous asteroids become less red with time due to space weathering, in agreement with predictions derived from laboratory experiments on the primitive Tagish Lake meteorite, which is spectrally similar to 596. This discovery provides the very first telescopic confirmation of the expected weathering trend of asteroids spectrally analog to Tagish Lake and/or anhydrous chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles. Our results also suggest that the population of implanted objects from the outer solar system is much larger than previously estimated in the main-belt, but many of these objects are hidden below their space-weathered surface.},

  abstract = {The surface of airless bodies like asteroids in the Solar System are known to be affected by space weathering. Experiments simulating space weathering are essential for studying the effects of this process on meteorite samples, but the problem is that the time spent to reproduce space weathering in these experiments is billions of times shorter than the actual phenomenon. In December 2010, the T-type asteroid 596 Scheila underwent a collision with a few-tens-of-meters impactor. A decade later, there is an opportunity to study how the surface layer of this asteroid is being altered by space weathering after the impact. To do so, we performed visible spectrophotometric and near-infrared spectroscopic observations of 596 Scheila. The acquired spectrum is consistent with those observed shortly after the 2010 impact event within the observational uncertainty range. This indicates that the surface color of dark asteroids is not noticeably changed by space weathering over a 10-year period. This study is the first to investigate color changes due to space weathering on an actual asteroid surface in the Solar System. Considering that fresh layers are regularly created on asteroid surfaces by collisions, we suggest a genetic link between D/T-type and dark (low albedo) X-complex asteroids and very red objects such as 269 Justitia, 732 Tjilaki (and 203 Pompeja). New observations show that 203 Pompeja has a X-type-like surface, with some local surface areas exhibiting a very red spectrum.},

  abstract = {Sites for next-generation telescopes are chosen decades before the first light of a telescope. Site selection is usually based on recent measurements over a period that is too short to account for long-term changes in observing conditions such as those arising from anthropogenic climate change. In this study, we analyse trends in astronomical observing conditions for eight sites. Most sites either already host telescopes that provide in situ measurements of weather parameters or are candidates for hosting next-generation telescopes. For a fine representation of orography, we use the highest resolution global climate model (GCM) ensemble available provided by the high-resolution model intercomparison project and developed as part of the European Union Horizon 2020 PRIMAVERA project. We evaluate atmosphere-only and coupled PRIMAVERA GCM historical simulations against in situ measurements and the fifth generation atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) of the ECMWF. The projections of changes in current site conditions are then analysed for the period 2015-2050 using PRIMAVERA future climate simulations. Over most sites, we find that PRIMAVERA GCMs show good agreement in temperature, specific humidity, and precipitable water vapour compared to in situ observations and ERA5. The ability of PRIMAVERA to simulate those variables increases confidence in their projections. For those variables, the model ensemble projects an increasing trend for all sites. On the other hand, no significant trends are projected for relative humidity, cloud cover, or astronomical seeing and PRIMAVERA does not simulate these variables well compared to observations and reanalyses. Therefore, there is little confidence in these projections. Our results show that climate change likely increases time lost due to bad site conditions.},

  abstract = {Exa-scale simulations are on the horizon but almost no new design for the output has been proposed in recent years. In simulations using individual time steps, the traditional snapshots are over resolving particles/cells with large time steps and are under resolving the particles/cells with short time steps. Therefore, they are unable to follow fast events and use efficiently the storage space. The Continuous Simulation Data Stream (CSDS) is designed to decrease this space while providing an accurate state of the simulation at any time. It takes advantage of the individual time step to ensure the same relative accuracy for all the particles. The outputs consist of a single file representing the full evolution of the simulation. Within this file, the particles are written independently and at their own frequency. Through the interpolation of the records, the state of the simulation can be recovered at any point in time. In this paper, we show that the CSDS can reduce the storage space by 2.76x for the same accuracy than snapshots or increase the accuracy by 67.8x for the same storage space whilst retaining an acceptable reading speed for analysis. By using interpolation between records, the CSDS provides the state of the simulation, with a high accuracy, at any time. This should largely improve the analysis of fast events such as supernovae and simplify the construction of light-cone outputs.},

The resulting data set is useful for the discovery of variable stars to a magnitude limit fainter than r{$\sim$}18, with amplitudes down to 0.02 mag for bright objects. Here, we present a Data Release One catalog of variable stars based on analyzing the light curves of 142 million stars that were measured at least 100 times in the first two years of ATLAS operations. Using a Lomb\textendash Scargle periodogram and other variability metrics, we identify 4.7 million candidate variables. Through the Space Telescope Science Institute, we publicly release light curves for all of them, together with a vector of 169 classification features for each star. We do this at the level of unconfirmed candidate variables in order to provide the community with a large set of homogeneously analyzed photometry and to avoid pre-judging which types of objects others may find most interesting. We use machine learning to classify the candidates into 15 different broad categories based on lightcurve morphology. About 10\% (427,000 stars) pass extensive tests designed to screen out spurious variability detections: we label these as ``probable'' variables. Of these, 214,000 receive specific classifications as eclipsing binaries, pulsating, Mira-type, or sinusoidal variables: these are the ``classified'' variables. New discoveries among the probable variables number 315,000, while 141,000 of the classified variables are new, including about 10,400 pulsating variables, 2060 Mira stars, and 74,700 eclipsing binaries.},

Most of the plausible sources of error tend toward underestimation, so the true populations are likely larger. We find the distribution of H magnitudes steepens for NEOs fainter than H {$\sim$} 22.5, making small asteroids more common than extrapolation from brighter H mags would predict. Our simulation indicates a strong bias against detecting small but dangerous asteroids that encounter Earth with high relative velocities\textemdash i.e., asteroids in highly inclined and/or eccentric orbits. Worldwide NEO discovery statistics indicate this bias affects global NEO detection capability to the point that an observational census of small asteroids in such orbits is probably not currently feasible. Prompt and aggressive followup of NEO candidates, combined with closer collaborations between segments of the global NEO community, can increase detection rates for these dangerous objects.},

We propose a technique for constraining physical properties of the proto-body, especially the initial spin period and cohesive strength, as a function of the body's estimated size and density. The breakup conditions are developed by combining mutual orbit dynamics of the smaller components and the failure condition of the proto-body. Given a proto-body with a bulk density ranging from 1000 kg m-3 to 1500 kg m-3 (a typical range of the bulk density of C-type asteroids), we obtain possible values of the cohesive strength (40\textendash 210 Pa) and the initial spin state (0.48\textendash 1.9 hr). From this result, we conclude that although the proto-body could have been a rubble pile, it was likely spinning beyond its gravitational binding limit and would have needed cohesive strength to hold itself together. Additional observations of P/2013 R3 will enable stronger constraints on this event, and the present technique will be able to give more precise estimates of its internal structure.},

We perform an analysis of spatial systematics in the photometric calibration, both inter- and intradetector show that these are present at up to the {$\sim$}5 per cent level in WFCAM. Although the causes of these systematics are not yet fully understood, a method for their removal is developed and tested. Following the application of the correction procedure, the photometric calibration of WFCAM is found to be accurate to {$\simeq$}1.5 per cent for the JHK bands and 2 per cent for the ZY bands, meeting the survey requirements. We investigate the transformations between the 2MASS and WFCAM systems and find that the Z and Y calibrations are sensitive to the effects of interstellar reddening for large values of E(B-V){${'}$}, but that the JHK filters remain largely unaffected. We measure a small correction to the WFCAM Y-band photometry required to place WFCAM on a Vega system, and investigate WFCAM measurements of published standard stars from the list of UKIRT faint standards.

  abstract = {The observation of small bodies in the Space Environment is an ongoing important task in astronomy. While nowadays new objects are mostly detected in larger sky surveys, several follow-up observations are usually needed for each object to improve the accuracy of orbit determination. In particular objects orbiting close to Earth, so called Near-Earth Objects are of special concern as a small but not negligible fraction of them can have a non-zero impact probability with Earth. Telescopes are often hosted by amateur observatories. With upcoming new NEO search campaigns by very wide field of view telescopes, like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, NASA's NEO surveyor space mission and ESA's Flyeye telescopes, the number of NEO discoveries will increase dramatically. This will require an increasing number of useful telescopes for follow-up observations at different geographical locations. While well-equipped amateur astronomers often host instruments which might be capable of creating useful measurements, both observation planning and scheduling, and also analysis are still a major challenge for many observers. In this work we present a fully robotic planning, scheduling and observation pipeline that extends the widely used open-source cross-platform software KStars/Ekos for INDI devices. The method consists of algorithms which automatically select NEO candidates with priority according to ESA's NEOCC. It then analyses detectable objects (based on limiting magnitudes, geographical position, and time) with preliminary ephemeris from the Minor Planet Center. Optimal observing slots during the night are calculated and scheduled. Immediately before the measurement the accurate position of the minor body is recalculated and finally the images are taken. Besides the detailed description of all components, we will show a complete robotic hard- and software solution based on our methods.},

  abstract = {The Jovian Trojans are two swarms of objects located around the L4 and L5 Lagrange points. The population is thought to have been captured by Jupiter during the Solar system's youth. Within the swarms, six collisional families have been identified in previous work, with four in the L4 swarm, and two in the L5. Our aim is to investigate the stability of the two Trojan swarms, with a particular focus on these collisional families. We find that the members of Trojan swarms escape the population at a linear rate, with the primordial L4 (23.35 per cent escape) and L5 (24.89 per cent escape) population sizes likely 1.31 and 1.35 times larger than today. Given that the escape rates were approximately equal between the two Trojan swarms, our results do not explain the observed asymmetry between the two groups, suggesting that the numerical differences are primordial in nature, supporting previous studies. Upon leaving the Trojan population, the escaped objects move on to orbits that resemble those of the Centaur and short-period comet populations. Within the Trojan collisional families, the 1996 RJ and 2001 UV209 families are found to be dynamically stable over the lifetime of the Solar system, whilst the Hektor, Arkesilos and Ennomos families exhibit various degrees of instability. The larger Eurybates family shows 18.81 per cent of simulated members escaping the Trojan population. Unlike the L4 swarm, the escape rate from the Eurybates family is found to increase as a function of time, allowing an age estimation of approximately 1.045 {$\pm$} 0.364 \texttimes{} 109 yr.},

  abstract = {Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) with small perihelion distances reach sub-solar temperatures of {$>$} 1000 K. They are hypothesized to undergo "super-catastrophic" disruption, potentially caused by near-Sun processes such as thermal cracking, spin-up, meteoroid impacts, and subsurface volatile release; all of which are likely to cause surface alteration, which may change the spectral slope of the surface. We attempted to observe 35 of the 53 known near-Sun asteroids with q {$<$} 0.15 au from January 2017 to March 2020 to search for trends related to near-Sun processes. We report the optical colors and spectral slopes of 22 objects that we successfully observed and the measured rotation periods for three objects. We find the distribution of colors to be overall bluer than the color distribution of NEAs, though there is large overlap. We attribute large scatter to unknown dynamical histories and compositions for individual objects, as well as competing surface altering processes. We also investigated potential correlations between colors and other properties (e.g., perihelion distance, Tisserand parameter, rotation period), and searched for evidence of activity. Finally, we have compiled all known physical and dynamical properties of these objects, including probabilistic source regions and dwell times with q {$<$} 0.15 au.},

Here we show for the first time that the average variation of the cosmic ray detection rates correlates with the global seismic activity to be observed with a time lag of approximately two weeks, and that the significance of the effect varies with a periodicity resembling the undecenal solar cycle, with a shift in phase of around three years, exceeding 6 sigma at local maxima. The precursor characteristics of the observed correlations point to a pioneer perspective of an early warning system against earthquakes.},

  abstract = {The recently discovered population of interstellar objects presents us with the opportunity to characterize material from extrasolar planetary and stellar systems up close. The forthcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide an unprecedented increase in sensitivity to these objects compared to the capabilities of currently operational observational facilities. In this paper, we generate a synthetic population of interstellar objects drawn from their galactic kinematics, and identify the distribution of impact parameters, eccentricities, hyperbolic velocities and sky locations of objects detectable with the LSST. This population is characterized by a clustering of trajectories in the direction of the solar apex and anti-apex, centered at orbital inclinations of {$\sim$} 90{$\smwhtcircle$}. We identify the ecliptic or solar apex as the optimal sky locations to search for future interstellar objects as a function of survey limiting magnitude. Moreover, we identify the trajectories of detectable objects that will be reachable for in-situ rendezvous with a dedicated mission with the capabilities of the forthcoming Comet Interceptor or proposed BRIDGE concept. By scaling our fractional population statistics with the inferred spatial number density, we estimate that the LSST will detect of order {$\sim$} 50 interstellar objects over the course of its {$\sim$} 10 year observational campaign. Furthermore, we find that there should be of order {$\sim$} 10 and {$\sim$} 0.05 reachable targets for missions with propulsion capabilities comparable to BRIDGE and Comet Interceptor, respectively. These number estimates will be readily updateable when the number density and size frequency distribution of interstellar objects is better constrained.},

We also reported delay-Doppler astrometric orbit corrections accurate at the 2 microsecond and 0.2 Hz level. The resulting orbital solution requires a significant non-gravitational acceleration to explain the pre- and post-perihelion observations. The radar bandwidth is a measure of the apparent differential motion of the nucleus about its rotation axis, projected into the line of sight. The apparent bandwidth of the comet nucleus was 30\% larger in March than in May, but did not change significantly during May 5-14. A change in apparent periodicity from 19.9 to 27 hours in March, reported by Farnham et al., (CBET4375, 2017) and Knight et al., (CBET4377, 2017) was deduced from CN jet morphology. Bodewits et al. (CBET4400, 2017) report a repetition period of 42 +/- 1 hours by May 9 based on photometry using the UVOT of the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission. If this is the nucleus rotation period, our observation on May 9 requires the diameter of the nucleus to be at least 900m. A larger size is possible but requires an extremely low radar albedo to match the measured signal to noise ratio. If the nucleus is in an excited rotation state (non-principal axis rotation), as seems likely, these measurements will strongly constrain the nucleus size and rotation state. Further analysis will be presented.},

The Arecibo images range from 75-m to 15-m resolution, and reveal an elongated nucleus about 2.5x3km in size. We did not detectevidence of large (few cm) grains in the coma, which have been detected in several other comets (e.g. Harmon et al. 2011). These images alone may not be sufficient to determine a detailed shape model, but they do constrain the size and rotation characteristics. Hergenrother observed the comet using the 1.8m VATT telescope and finds the rotation rate to be either 10.9 or 21.9 hours, however the radar data rule out the longer period. The highest resolution (15m) images show unusual surface features, unlike radar images of similar-sized asteroids. The six comet nuclei imaged by spacecraft to date, show great diversity in surface structure, texture and distribution of volatiles. More examples are needed in order to understand the formation and evolution of comets. Interpretation of the radar surface features of 209P/LINEAR and comparison to other comet nuclei will be presented.},

Photometric observations were performed using the 1.2m telescope at the Haute-Provence observatory (France) in the BVRI filters of the Johnson-Cousins photometric systems between June 2021 and April 2022. We obtained new surface colors for 42 NEOs. Based on the measured colors we classified 20 objects as S-complex, 9 as C-complex, 9 as X-complex, 2 as D-type, one object as V-type, and one object remained unclassified. For all the observed objects we estimated their absolute magnitudes and diameters. Combining these new observations with the previously acquired data within the NEOROCKS project extended our dataset to 93 objects. The majority of objects in the dataset with diameters D{$<$}500m belongs to a group of silicate bodies, which could be related to observational bias. Based on MOID and \$\textbackslash Delta\$V values we selected 14 objects that could be accessible by a spacecraft. Notably, we find D-type asteroid (163014) 2001 UA5 and A-type asteroid 2017 SE19 to be of particular interest as possible space mission targets.},

During the 2021 observation period, the coma declined in intrinsic brightness by {$\sim$}0.35 mag (or {$\sim$}25\%) in 37 days, while the surface brightness of the dust tail remained effectively constant over the same period. Constraints derived from the sunward extent of the coma and width of the tail as measured perpendicular to the orbit plane suggest that the terminal velocities of ejected dust grains are extremely slow ({$\sim$}1 m s               -1               for 1               {$\mu$}               m particles), suggesting that the observed dust emission may be aided by rapid rotation of the nucleus lowering the effective escape velocity.},

The case of P/2019 LD2 highlights the need for mechanisms to quickly and reliably dynamically classify small solar system bodies discovered in current and upcoming wide-field surveys.},

  abstract = {There is a complex inclination structure present in the transneptunian object (TNO) orbital distribution in the main classical belt region (between orbital semimajor axes of 39 and 48 au). The long-term gravitational effects of the giant planets make TNO orbits precess, but non-resonant objects maintain a nearly constant 'free' inclination (\$I\_\textbackslash text\{free\}\$) with respect to a local forced precession pole. Because of the likely cosmogonic importance of the distribution of this quantity, we tabulate free inclinations for all main-belt TNOs, each individually computed using barycentric orbital elements with respect to each object's local forcing pole. We show that the simplest method, based on the Laplace-Lagrange secular theory, is unable to give correct forcing poles for objects near the \$\textbackslash nu\_\{18\}\$ secular resonance, resulting in poorly conserved \$I\_\textbackslash text\{free\}\$ values in much of the main belt. We thus instead implemented an averaged Hamiltonian to obtain the expected nodal precession for each TNO, yielding significantly more accurate free inclinations for non-resonant objects. For the vast majority (96\textbackslash\%) of classical belt TNOs, these \$I\_\textbackslash text\{free\}\$ values are conserved to \${$<$}1\^\textbackslash circ\$ over 4 Gyr numerical simulations, demonstrating the advantage of using this well-conserved quantity in studies of the TNO population and its primordial inclination profile; our computed distributions only reinforce the idea of a very co-planar surviving 'cold' primordial population, overlain by a large \$I\$-width implanted 'hot' population.},

  abstract = {The orbital distribution of transneptunian objects (TNOs) in the distant Kuiper Belt (with semimajor axes beyond the 2:1 resonance, roughly \$a\$=50-100 au) provides constraints on the dynamical history of the outer solar system. Recent studies show two striking features of this region: 1) a very large population of objects in distant mean-motion resonances with Neptune, and 2) the existence of a substantial detached population (non-resonant objects largely decoupled from Neptune). Neptune migration models are able to implant some resonant and detached objects during the planet migration era, but many fail to match a variety of aspects of the orbital distribution. In this work, we report simulations carried out using an improved version of the GPU-based code GLISSE, following 100,000 test particles per simulation in parallel while handling their planetary close encounters. We demonstrate for the first time that a 2 Earth-mass rogue planet temporarily present during planet formation can abundantly populate both the distant resonances and the detached populations, surprisingly even without planetary migration. We show how weak encounters with the rogue greatly increase the efficiency of filling the resonances, while also dislodging TNOs out of resonance once they reach high perihelia. The rogue's secular gravitational influence simultaneously generates numerous detached objects observed at all semimajor axes. These results suggest that the early presence of additional planet(s) reproduces the observed TNO orbital structure in the distant Kuiper Belt.},

The main activity of the atmospheres node is to provide an interaction between the professional and amateur astronomical communities maintaining a large database of images of the giant planets (primarily Jupiter and Saturn but with increasing contributions of Uranus and Neptune too). The observational datasets of Jupiter and Saturn correspond to images obtained in the visible range (300 nm\textendash 1 mm), during the last decade, most of them performed by amateur observers. We here describe the organization and structure of the database as posted on the Internet and in particular the PVOL software (Planetary Virtual Observatory Laboratory) designed to manage the site in the spirit of the Virtual Observatory projects. We also describe with examples the important role of the amateur\textendash professional collaboration in the study of the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn in an epoch of large telescopes and spacecraft observations of both planets.},

We also present results from a systematic search of impacts on {$>$}72 000 video amateur observations with a customized software that is based on differential photometry of the images. An examination of the number of amateur observations of Jupiter as a function of time over the past years allows us to interpret the statistics of these impact detections. Results. The cumulative flux of small objects (5\textendash 20 m or larger) that impact Jupiter is predicted to be low (10\textendash 65 impacts per year), and only a fraction of them are potentially observable from Earth (4\textendash 25 observable impacts per year in a perfect survey). These numbers imply that many observers are required to efficiently discover Jupiter impacts. Conclusions. We predict that more impacts will be found in the next years, with Jupiter opposition displaced toward summer in the northern hemisphere where most amateur astronomers observe. Objects of this size contribute negligibly to the abundance of exogenous species and dust in the stratosphere of Jupiter when compared with the continuous flux from interplanetary dust particles punctuated by giant impacts. Flashes of a high enough brightness (comparable at their peak to a +3.3 magnitude star) could produce an observable debris field on the planet. We estimate that a continuous search for these impacts might find these events once every 0.4\textendash 2.6 yr.},

Using archival images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope from 2015 to 2018, we measured the astrometry of the primary and the three brightest (presumably the largest) components. Conventional orbit determination revealed a high-degree of orbital similarity between the components. We then applied a fragmentation model to fit the astrometry, obtaining key parameters including the fragmentation epochs and separation velocities. Our best-fit models show that Fragment B separated from the primary body at a speed of \$\textbackslash sim\$1 cm s\$\^\{-1\}\$ between 2011 April and May, whereas two plausible scenarios were identified for Fragments A and C. The former split either from the primary or from Fragment B, in 2011 mid-June at a speed of \$\textbackslash sim\$8 cm s\$\^\{-1\}\$, and the latter split from Fragment B either in late 2011 or between late 2013 and early 2014, at a speed of \$\textbackslash sim\$0.7-0.8 cm s\$\^\{-1\}\$. The results are consistent with rotational disruption as the mechanism causing the cascading fragmentation of the asteroid, as suggested by the rapid rotation of the primary. The fragments constitute the youngest known asteroid cluster, providing us with a great opportunity to study asteroid fragmentation and formation of asteroid clusters.},

The signal of the nucleus was successfully isolated by means of a nucleus extraction technique, with an apparent V-band magnitude measured to be 21.65 {$\pm$} 0.11, corresponding to an absolute magnitude of 8.63 {$\pm$} 0.11. The product of the visual geometric albedo with the effective radius squared is pV Rn2 = 157  16 km2. If the ALMA observation by Lellouch et al. refers to a bare nucleus, we derived a visual geometric albedo of 0.033 {$\pm$} 0.009. If dust contamination of the ALMA signal is present at the maximum allowed level (24\%), we found an albedo of 0.044 {$\pm$} 0.012 for the nucleus having an effective diameter of 119 {$\pm$} 15 km. In either case, we confirm that C/2014 UN271 is the largest long-period comet ever detected. Judging from the measured surface brightness profile of the coma, whose logarithmic gradient varies azimuthally between {$\sim$}1.0 and 1.7 as a consequence of solar radiation pressure, the mass production is consistent with steady-state production but not with impulsive ejection, as would be produced by an outburst. Using aperture photometry, we estimated an enormous (albeit uncertain) mass-loss rate of {$\sim$}103 kg s-1 at a heliocentric distance of {$\sim$}20 au.},

In late December 2020, the object was recovered at Subaru showing no cometary features on its way to perihelion. However, in our postperihelion observations it developed a long narrow tail mimicking a disintegrating cometary debris cloud. The ejecta, comprised of at least mm-sized dust with power-law size distribution index \$3.2 \textbackslash pm 0.2\$, was impulsively produced shortly after the perihelion passage, during which \$\textbackslash gtrsim\$0.1-10\% of the nucleus mass was shed due to excessive thermal stress and rotational disruption. Two fragments of \$\textbackslash sim\$20 m in radius (assuming a geometric albedo of 0.15) were seen in HST observations from early March 2021. The nucleus, with an effective radius of \$86 \textbackslash pm 3\$ m (the same albedo assumed) and an aspect ratio of \$\textbackslash lesssim\$0.7, has a rotation period of 0.522 hr, which is the shortest for known comets in the solar system and implies cohesive strength \$\textbackslash gtrsim\$10-100 Pa in the interior. The colour of the object was peculiar, and how it changed temporally has never been previously observed. Using our astrometry, we found a strong nongravitational effect following a heliocentric dependency of \$r\_\{\textbackslash rm H\}\^\{-8.5\}\$ in the transverse motion of the object. Our N-body integration reveals that 323P has a likelihood of 99.7\% to collide with the Sun in the next two millennia driven by the \$\textbackslash nu\_6\$ secular resonance.},

Thus far only one transient member (2010 TK7) has been discovered serendipitously. Here, we present a dynamical study of asteroid 2020 XL5. With our meticulous followup astrometric observations of the object, we confirmed that it is a new Earth Trojan. However, its eccentric orbit brings it close encounters with Venus on a frequent basis. Based on our N-body integration, we found that the asteroid was captured into the current Earth Trojan status in the 15th century, and then it has a likelihood of 99.5\% to leave the L4 region within the next {$\sim$}10 kyr. Therefore, it is most likely that 2020 XL5 is dynamically unstable over this timescale.},

We here present analyses of our observations of the comet taken from the LCO Outbursting Objects Key project and the University of Hawaii 2.2 m telescope after the discovery of the splitting. The two fragments Components A and B, estimated to be {$\sim$}60 m to 4 km in radius, remained highly similar to each other in terms of brightness, color, and dust morphology throughout our observing campaign from 2020 September to 2021 December. Our fragmentation model yielded that the two components split at a relative speed of 3.00 {$\pm$} 0.18 m s-1 in 2020 late April, implying a specific energy change of J kg-1, and that Component B was subjected to a stronger nongravitational acceleration than Component A in both the radial and normal directions of the orbit. The obtained splitting time is broadly consistent with the result from the dust morphology analysis, which further suggested that the dominant dust grains were millimeter-sized and ejected at a speed of {$\sim$}2 m s-1. We postulate that the pre-split nucleus of the comet consisted of two lobes resembling that of 67P, or that the comet used to be a binary system like main-belt comet 288P.

We apply fits to the diameters \$D\$ (km) and thermal inertia \$\textbackslash Gamma\$ (J m\$\^\{-2\}\$ s\$\^\{-0.5\}\$ K\$\^\{-1\}\$) normalized to 1 au with a linear relation of the form \$\textbackslash log[\textbackslash Gamma]=\textbackslash alpha+\textbackslash beta\textbackslash log[D]\$, where we find \$\textbackslash alpha = 2.667 \textbackslash pm 0.059\$ and \$\textbackslash beta = -0.467 \textbackslash pm 0.044\$ for our sample alone and \$\textbackslash alpha = 2.509 \textbackslash pm 0.017\$ and \$\textbackslash beta = -0.352 \textbackslash pm 0.012\$ when combined with other literature estimates. We find little evidence of any correlation between rotation period and thermal inertia, owing to the small number of slow rotators to consider in our sample. While the large uncertainties on the majority of our derived thermal inertia only allow us to identify broad trends between thermal inertia and other physical parameters, we can expect a significant increase in high-quality thermal flux measurements and asteroid shape models with upcoming infrared and wide-field surveys, enabling even more thermophysical modeling of higher precision in the future.},

  abstract = {Selecting a cohort from a set of candidates is a common task within and beyond academia. Admitting students, awarding grants, choosing speakers for a conference are situations where human biases may affect the make-up of the final cohort. We propose a new algorithm, Entrofy, designed to be part of a larger decision making strategy aimed at making cohort selection as just, quantitative, transparent, and accountable as possible. We suggest this algorithm be embedded in a two-step selection procedure. First, all application materials are stripped of markers of identity that could induce conscious or sub-conscious bias. During blind review, the committee selects all applicants, submissions, or other entities that meet their merit-based criteria. This often yields a cohort larger than the admissible number. In the second stage, the target cohort can be chosen from this meritorious pool via a new algorithm and software tool. Entrofy optimizes differences across an assignable set of categories selected by the human committee. Criteria could include gender, academic discipline, experience with certain technologies, or other quantifiable characteristics. The Entrofy algorithm yields the computational maximization of diversity by solving the tie-breaking problem with provable performance guarantees. We show how Entrofy selects cohorts according to pre-determined characteristics in simulated sets of applications and demonstrate its use in a case study. This cohort selection process allows human judgment to prevail when assessing merit, but assigns the assessment of diversity to a computational process less likely to be beset by human bias. Importantly, the stage at which diversity assessments occur is fully transparent and auditable with Entrofy. Splitting merit and diversity considerations into their own assessment stages makes it easier to explain why a given candidate was selected or rejected.},

  abstract = {Top-shaped asteroids have been observed among near-Earth asteroids. About half of them are reported to have moons (on the order of {$\sim$}1 wt.\% of the top-shaped primary) and many of them have an equatorial ridge. A recent study has shown that the enigmatic top-shaped figure of asteroids (e.g., Ryugu, Bennu, and Didymos) could result from an axisymmetric landslide of the primary during a fast spin-up near the breakup rotation period. Such a landslide would inevitably form a particulate disk around an asteroid with a short timescale ({$\sim$}3 hr). However, the long-term full dynamical evolution is not investigated. Here, we perform a continuous simulation ({$\sim$}700 hr) that investigates the sequence of events from the surface landslide that forms a top-shaped asteroid and a particulate disk to disk evolution. We show that the disk quickly spreads and produces moons (within {$\sim$}300 hr). The mass of the formed moon is consistent with what is observed around the top-shaped asteroids. We also demonstrate that an equatorial ridge is naturally formed because a fraction of the disk particles re-accretes selectively onto the equatorial region of the primary. We envision that Ryugu and Bennu could once have an ancient moon that was later lost due to a successive moon's orbital evolution. Alternatively, at a top-shaped asteroid that has a moon, such as Didymos, no significant orbital evolution of the moon has occurred that would result in its loss. Our study would also be qualitatively applicable to any rubble-pile asteroids near the breakup rotation period.},

When calculating the inward drift of solids that is due to gas drag, we included the back-reaction of the gas to the motion of the solids. Results. We show that in low-viscosity protoplanetary disks (with a monotonous surface density similar to that of the minimum-mass solar nebula), the flow of pebbles does not usually reach the required surface density to form planetesimals by streaming instability. We show, however, that if the pebble-to-gas-mass flux exceeds a critical value, no steady solution can be found for the solid-to-gas ratio. This is particularly important for low-viscosity disks ({$\alpha$} {$<$} 10-3) where we show that inside of the snow line, silicate-dust grains ejected from sublimating pebbles can accumulate, eventually leading to the formation of dust-rich planetesimals directly by gravitational instability. Conclusions. This formation of dust-rich planetesimals may occur for extended periods of time, while the snow line sweeps from several au to inside of 1 au. The rock-to-ice ratio may thus be globally significantly higher in planetesimals and planets than in the central star.},

  abstract = {In the standard theory of the formation of planets in our Solar System, terrestrial planets and the cores of gas giant planets are formed through accretion of km size objects (planetesimals) in the protoplanetary disk. The gravitational N -body simulations of planetesimal systems is the most direct way to study the accretion process of the planets. However, the use of N -body simulations has been limited to idealized model (e.g., perfect accretion) and/or narrow radial range, due to the limited number of particles available. We have developed a new N -body simulation code with particle-particle particle-tree (P3T) scheme for planetary system formation, GPLUM. GPLUM uses a fourth-order Hermite scheme to calculate gravitational interactions between particles within cut-off radii of individual particles and the Barnes-Hut tree scheme for gravitational interactions with particles outside the cut-off radii. In existing implementations of the P3T schemes, the same cut-off radius is used for all particles. Thus, when the range of the mass of the planetesimals becomes large, the calculation speed decreases. We have solved this problem by allowing each particle to determine its appropriate cutoff radius depending on its mass, distance from the central star, and the local velocity dispersion, and thus achieved a significant speedup when the range of the masses of particles is wide. We have also improved the scalability of the code, and have achieved good strong-scaling performance for up to 1,024 cores in the case of N = 106.

  abstract = {The investigation of asteroids near the Sun is important for understanding the final evolutionary stage of primitive solar system objects. A near-Sun asteroid, (155140) 2005 UD, has orbital elements similar to those of (3200) Phaethon (the target asteroid for the JAXA's DESTINY+ mission). We conducted photometric and polarimetric observations of 2005 UD and found that this asteroid exhibits a polarization phase curve similar to that of Phaethon over a wide range of observed solar phase angles ({$\mathsl{A}$} = 20-105{$\smwhtcircle$}) but different from those of (101955) Bennu and (162173) Ryugu (asteroids composed of hydrated carbonaceous materials). At a low phase angle ({$\mathsl{A}$} 30{$\smwhtcircle$}), the polarimetric properties of these near-Sun asteroids (2005 UD and Phaethon) are consistent with anhydrous carbonaceous chondrites, while the properties of Bennu are consistent with hydrous carbonaceous chondrites. We derived the geometric albedo, {$\mathsl{p}$}V {$\sim$} 0.1 (in the range of 0.088-0.109); mean {$\mathsl{V}$}-band absolute magnitude, {$\mathsl{H}$}V = 17.54 {$\pm$} 0.02; synodic rotational period, {$\mathsl{T}$}rot = 5.2388 {$\pm$} 0.0022 hours (the two-peaked solution is assumed); and effective mean diameter, {$\mathsl{D}$}eff = 1.32 {$\pm$} 0.06 km. At large phase angles ({$\mathsl{A}$} 80{$\smwhtcircle$}), the polarization phase curve are likely explained by the dominance of large grains and the paucity of small micron-sized grains. We conclude that the polarimetric similarity of these near-Sun asteroids can be attributed to the intense solar heating of carbonaceous materials around their perihelia, where large anhydrous particles with small porosity could be produced by sintering.},

This is more than 10 times larger than any sample that includes both orbital parameters and multiband photometric measurements previously available. We confirm that asteroid dynamical families, defined as clusters in orbital parameter space, also strongly segregate in color space. In particular, we demonstrate that the three major asteroid families (Eos, Koronis, and Themis) together with the Vesta family represent four main asteroid color types. Their distinctive optical colors indicate that the variations in chemical composition within a family are much smaller than the compositional differences between families, and they strongly support earlier suggestions that asteroids belonging to a particular family have a common origin. We estimate that over 90\% of asteroids belong to families.},

The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pach\'on in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg2 field of view, a 3.2-gigapixel camera, and six filters (ugrizy) covering the wavelength range 320\textendash 1050 nm. The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg2 region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to r{$\sim$}27.5. These data will result in databases including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are currently under discussion. We illustrate how the LSST science drivers led to these choices of system parameters, and we describe the expected data products and their characteristics.},

Observations of asteroids with these types of facilities often focus on rotational brightness variations rather than longer-term phase angle-dependent variations (phase curves) due to the difficulty of achieving high precision photometric calibration. We have developed an automated asteroid light curve extraction and calibration pipeline for images of moving objects from the 0.43 m Physics Innovations Robotic Telescope Explorer. This allows for the frequency and quality of observations required to construct asteroid phase curves. Optimizations in standard data reduction procedures are identified that may allow for similar small aperture facilities, constructed from commercially available/off-the-shelf components, to improve the image and subsequent data quality. A demonstration of the hardware and software capabilities is expressed through observation statistics from a 10 months observing campaign, and through the photometric characterization of near-Earth Asteroids 8014 (1990 MF) and 19764 (2000 NF5).},

In this study, we demonstrate the additional dependence of phase curves on object shape, rotation pole orientation, and viewing geometry over an apparition. Variations in the phase curve of near-Earth asteroid (159402) 1999 AP10 over its apparition from 2020 July to 2021 January are verified to be due to aspect changes over the apparition. This is achieved through shape modelling of the asteroid and simulation of the phase curve over the apparition. We present simulations of asteroid phase curves over a range of geometries to understand the potential magnitude of this aspect effect, and under which circumstances it can begin to dominate in the phase curves. This dependence on aspect may introduce significant additional uncertainty in the properties derived from phase-curve data. We provide and demonstrate software code to estimate the aspect-related uncertainty in near-Earth asteroid phase curves through simulation and model fitting of a randomly generated sample of ellipsoidal asteroid models over the observed viewing geometry. We demonstrate how ignoring this effect may lead to misleading interpretations of the data and underestimation of uncertainties in further studies, such as those in the infrared that use phase curve derived parameters when fitting physical properties of an asteroid.},

A comparison of SDSS and PG photometry of both stars and quasars reveals the need to apply a color and magnitude recalibration to the PG data. Using the SDSS photometric catalog, we define the PG's parent sample of objects that are not main-sequence stars and simulate the selection of objects from this parent sample using the PG photometric criteria and errors. This simulation shows that the effective U \`A B cut in the PG survey is U \`A B {$<$} \`A0:71, implying a color-related incompleteness. As the color distribution of bright quasars peaks near U \`A B {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A0:7 and the 2   error in U \`A B is comparable to the full width of the color distribution of quasars, the color incompleteness of the BQS is approximately 50\% and essentially random with respect to U \`A B color for z {$<$} 0:5. There is, however, a bias against bright quasars at 0:5 {$<$} z {$<$} 1, which is induced by the color-redshift relation of quasars (although quasars at z {$>$} 0:5 are inherently rare in bright surveys in any case). We find no evidence for any other systematic incompleteness when comparing the distributions in color, redshift, and FIRST radio properties of the BQS and a BQS-like subsample of the SDSS quasar sample. However, the application of a bright magnitude limit biases the BQS toward the inclusion of objects that are blue in g \`A i, in particular compared to the full range of g \`A i colors found among the i-band limited SDSS quasars, and even at i-band magnitudes comparable to those of the BQS objects.},

It also shows that 2003 WY25 is a continuing but weak source of particles for the Phoenicid meteor stream with a mass injection rate into the stream of \$10\`A2 kg s\`A1. This is too small to supply the estimated 1011 kg stream mass on any plausible timescale, suggesting that the mass injection into the stream may be episodic and/or involve additional sources. We estimate a nucleus radius near 160 m and find that, consistent with estimates for other meteor streams, the ratio of the nucleus mass to the stream mass is of order unity. We find that 2003 WY25 is the smallest cometary nucleus yet observed.},

These are, first, the heliocentric dependence of the dust velocity and, second, a lag effect due to very slow-moving particles ejected long before the observations were taken. A Monte Carlo model of the photometry shows that dust production beginning at               r                                H                              {$\sim$} 35 au is needed to match the measured heliocentric index, with only a slight dependence on the particle size distribution.

Consequently, the ratio of the nongravitational acceleration to the local solar gravity,               {$\alpha$}               {${'}$}, may, depending on the nucleus size, attain values of {$\sim$}10               -7               {$\lessequivlnt$}               {$\alpha$}               {${'}$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 10               -5               , comparable to values found in short-period comets at much smaller distances.

Seven of the 27 comets (i.e. 25 percent) did not survive perihelion because of nucleus fragmentation or complete disintegration. Empirically, the latter nuclei have the smallest gas production rates and the largest non-gravitational accelerations, which are both indicators of small size. Specifically, the disintegrating nuclei have a median radius of only 0.41 km, one quarter of the 1.60 km median radius of those surviving perihelion. The disintegrating comets also have a smaller median perihelion distance (0.48 au) than do the survivors (0.99 au). We compare the order of magnitude timescale for outgassing torques to change the nucleus spin, tau, with the time spent by each comet in strong sublimation, Dt, finding that the disrupted comets are those with tau {$<$} Dt. The destruction of near-Sun long-period comets is thus naturally explained as a consequence of rotational break-up.

As an inner-belt asteroid and probable Flora family member, the object is likely to be highly metamorphosed and unlikely to contain ice.

The largest shows a photometric range ({$\sim$}1.5 magnitudes), a V-shaped minimum and a two-peaked lightcurve period near 9 hours, consistent with a symmetric contact binary (Drahus and Waniak 2016). Less convincing explanations are that 331P-A is a monolithic, elongated splinter or that its surface shows hemispheric 4:1 albedo variations. The debris trail is composed of centimeter sized and larger particles ejected with characteristic 10 cm s-1 speeds following a size distribution with index q = 3.7{$\pm$}0.1 to 4.1{$\pm$}0.2. The HST data show that earlier, groundbased measurements of the nucleus were contaminated by near-nucleus debris, which cleared by 2015. We find that the primary nucleus has effective radius 0.8{$\pm$}0.1 km and is in rapid rotation (3.26{$\pm$}0.01 hour, range 0.25 magnitudes, minimum density 1600 kg m-3 if strengthless. The properties of 331P are consistent with a) formation about 1.5 Myr ago by impact shattering of a precursor body (Novakovic et al. 2014) b) spin-up by radiation torques to critical rotation c) ejection of about 1\% of the nucleus mass in mid-2011 by rotational instability and d) subsequent evolution of the fragments and dispersal of the debris by radiation pressure.},

The nucleus remained point-like with absolute magnitude HV = 8.85 {$\pm$} 0.02 in our data, equal to the pre-outburst value, with no secondary fragments of diameter 100 m (for assumed albedos 0.04). We find a coma having a peak scattering cross section {$\sim$}2.2 \texttimes{} 104 km2, corresponding to a mass in micron-sized particles of {$\sim$}4 \texttimes{} 107 kg. The particles are deflected by solar radiation pressure on projected spatial scales {$\sim$}2 \texttimes{} 104 km, in the sunward direction, and swept from the vicinity of the nucleus on timescales of weeks. The coma fades by {$\sim$}30\% between observations on UT 2010 December 27 and 2011 January 4. The observed mass loss is inconsistent with an origin either by rotational instability of the nucleus or by electrostatic ejection of regolith charged by sunlight. Dust ejection could be caused by the sudden but unexplained exposure of buried ice. However, the data are most simply explained by the impact, at {$\sim$}5 km s-1, of a previously unknown asteroid {$\sim$}35 m in diameter.},

The building blocks of the framework are Metrics (algorithms to analyze a given quantity of data), Slicers (subdividing the overall data set into smaller data slices as relevant for each Metric), and Database classes (to access the dataset and read data into memory). We describe how these building blocks work together, and provide an example of using MAF to evaluate different dithering strategies.

We find 2641 unique matches, which represent the largest sample of asteroids with both accurate multicolor photometry and known orbital parameters. The matched objects are predominantly bright and demonstrate that the SDSS photometric pipeline recovers \$90\% of the known asteroids in the observed region. For the recovered asteroids, we find a large offset (\$0.4 mag) between Johnson V magnitudes derived from SDSS photometry and the predicted magnitudes. This offset varies with the asteroid color, from 0.34 mag for blue asteroids to 0.44 mag for red asteroids, and is probably caused by the use of unfiltered CCD observations in the majority of recent asteroid surveys. This systematic photometric error leads to an overestimate of the number of asteroids brighter than a given absolute magnitude limit by a factor of \$1.7. The distribution of the matched asteroids in orbital parameter space indicates strong color segregation. We confirm that some families are dominated by a single asteroid type (e.g., the Koronis family by red asteroids and the Themis family by blue asteroids), while others appear to be a mixture of blue and red objects (e.g., the Nysa-Polana family). Asteroids with the bluest i*\`Az* colors, which can be associated with the Vesta family, show particularly striking localization in orbital parameter space.},

But how and when these features formed is much debated, with distinct implications for solar system formation, dynamics, and geology.

We identify two regimes of interest: layer-forming splats and mergers resulting in bilobed shapes. For bodies with low tensile strength, our results can explain key morphologies of cometary nuclei, as well as their low bulk densities. This advances the hypothesis that nuclei formed by collisional coagulation\textemdash either out of cometesimals accreting in the early solar system or, alternatively, out of comparable-sized debris clumps paired in the aftermath of major collisions.},

Here our numerical simulations show that comet observing campaigns miss vast numbers of LPCs making returning passages through the Saturn region (near 10 au) because these comets fade during prior, even more distant passages exterior to Saturn and thus elude detection. Consequently, comet properties significantly evolve at solar distances much larger than previously considered, and this offers new insights into the physical and dynamical properties of LPCs, both near and far from Earth.},

The first single telescope system, PS1, has been deployed on Haleakala on Maui, and has been collecting science quality survey data for approximately six months. PS1 will be joined by a second telescope PS2 in approximately 18 months. A four aperture system is planned to become operational following the end of the PS1 mission. This will be able to scan the entire visible sky to approximately 24th magnitude in less than a week, thereby meeting the goals set out by the NAS 2000 decadal review for a "Large Synoptic Sky Telescope". Here we review the technical design, and give an update on the progress that has been made with the PS1 system.},

Here we present new photometric properties of 45 Jovian Trojans from the K2 mission of the Kepler space telescope, and present phase-folded light curves for 44 targets, including (11351) Leucus, one of the targets of the Lucy mission. We extend our sample to 101 asteroids with previous K2 Trojan measurements, then compare their combined amplitude and frequency distributions to other ground-based and space data. We show that there is a dichotomy in the periods of Trojans with a separation at {$\sim$}100 hr. We find that 25\% of the sample are slow rotators (P  30 hr), an excess that can be attributed to binary objects. We also show that 32 systems can be classified as potential detached binary systems. Finally, we calculate density and rotation constraints for the asteroids. Both the spin barrier and fits to strengthless ellipsoid models indicate low densities and thus compositions similar to populations of comets and trans-Neptunian objects throughout the sample. This supports the scenario of outer solar system origin for Jovian Trojans.},

  abstract = {Coarse objects in chondrites such as chondrules and CAIs are mostly coated with fine-grained rims (FGRs). FGRs can be formed on the surface of free floating chondrules in a turbulent nebula, where dust aggregation also occurs. A former study has reported that the morphology of the dust populations accreting onto chondrules affects the initial structures of FGRs. It was revealed that, if monomer grains accrete onto chondrules, the smaller grains tend to accumulate near the surface of chondrules, and FGRs exhibit grain size coarsening from the bottom to the top. However, the study did not consider the effect of temporal growth of dust aggregates on FGRs formation. In this study, we calculate the aggregation of polydisperse monomer grains and their accretion onto chondrules. The following two different stages of dust aggregation can be identified: the monomer-aggregation stage and the BCCA-like stage. In the monomer-aggregation stage, monomer grains are incorporated into aggregates when the average aggregate size reaches the size of the monomer. In the BCCA-like stage, aggregates evolve fractally in a fashion similar to that of single size monomer grains. Based on the results of the previous study, we obtain the requisite conditions for chondrules to acquire monomer-accreting FGRs with grain size coarsening observed in some chondrites. In the case of similar size distribution as that of Inter Stellar Medium (ISM), the maximum grain size of {$>$} 1 \textmu m is widely ({$\alpha$} {$<$} 10-3) required for monomer accretion, while if turbulent intensity in a nebula is extremely weak ({$\alpha$} {$<$} 10-5), a maximum grain size {$\sim$} 10 \textmu m is required. The monomer size distributions having larger mass fraction in the large grains compared to ISM might be necessary for the effective grain size coarsening.},

BA\$\_\{14\}\$ also recently selected one of the back-up targets for the ESA's \textbackslash textit\{Comet Interceptor\}, so a clearer understanding of BA\$\_\{14\}\$'s modern properties would not just improve our understanding of how comets go dormant, but could also aid planning for a potential spacecraft visit. We present observations of BA\$\_\{14\}\$ taken on two dates during its 2016 Earth close approach with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, both of which are consistent with direct observations of its nucleus. The reflectance spectrum of BA\$\_\{14\}\$ is similar to 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, albeit highly phase-reddened. Thermal emission contaminates the reflectance spectrum at longer wavelengths, which we correct with a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo thermal modeling code. The models suggest \$BA\_\{14\}\$'s visible geometric albedo is \$p\_V=0.01-0.03\$, consistent with radar observations, its beaming parameter is typical for NEOs observed in its geometry, and its reflectrance spectrum is red and linear throughout H and K band. It appears very much like a "normal" comet nucleus, despite its mid-infrared oddities. A slow loss of fine grains as the object's activity diminished might help to reconcile some of the lines of evidence, and we discuss other possibilities. A spacecraft flyby past BA\$\_\{14\}\$ could get closer to the nucleus than with a more active target, and we highlight some science questions that could be addressed with a visit to a (nearly-)dormant comet.},

  abstract = {Context. The effects of planetesimal fragmentation on planet formation has been studied by various models on single embryos therefore neglecting concurrent effects mostly in the outer disk. They show that planetesimal fragmentation can both hinder or aid planet formation due to the introduction of competing effects, namely speeding up accretion and depleting the feeding zone of forming planets. Aims. We investigate the influence of the collisional fragmentation of planetesimals on the planet formation process using a population synthesis approach. We aim to investigate its effects for a large set of initial conditions and also explore the consequences on the formation of multiple embryos in the same disk. Methods. We run global planet formation simulations including fragmentation, drift and an improved ice line description. To do this we use a fragmentation model in our code. The initial conditions for the simulations that are informed by observations are varied to generate synthetic exoplanet populations. Results. Our synthetic populations show that depending on the typical size of solids generated in collisions, fragmentation in tandem with the radial drift can either enhance or hinder planet formation. For larger fragments we see increased accretion throughout the populations especially beyond the ice line. However, the shorter drift timescale of smaller fragments, due to their stronger coupling to the gas, can hinder the formation process. Furthermore, beyond the ice line fragmentation promotes late growth when the damping by gas drag fades Conclusions. Fragmentation significantly affects the planet formation process in various ways for all types of planet and warrants further investigation.},

The crucial calibration parameters required for the all-sky photometry analysis such as atmospheric extinctioncoefficient, air-mass, zero point, color term and color index are discussed comprehensively with their extraction from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) archive. The all-sky aperture photometry technique is applied on the stars of the open cluster NGC 2420 to determine their calibrated magnitudes and magnitude errors in the g, r, and i bands. The images required for the analysis are extracted from data release DR12 of SDSS III archive. Herein, the photometry analysis is performed by the Makali'i: SUBARU Image Processor, a Windowsbased software. This software has a simple yet effective GUI and it provides the starlight minus the background sky light value with a single click. This article would aid in providing the insight into the physics of aperture photometry by manually scanning the astronomical images.

These objects likely formed \textbackslash textit\{in situ\} and the population has experienced minimal collisional modification since formation. Using the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) ensemble sample and characterization, combined with constraints from deeper surveys and supported by evidence from the Minor Planet Center catalog and the Deep Ecliptic Survey, we determine the absolute magnitude \$H\_r\$ distribution of the cold classical belt from \$H\_r\textbackslash simeq5\$ to 12 (roughly diameters of 400 km to 20 km). We conclude that the cold population's \$H\_r\$ distribution exhibits an exponential cutoff at large sizes. Exponential cutoffs at large sizes are not a natural outcome of pair-wise particle accretion but exponentially tapered power-law size distributions are a feature of numerical simulations of planetesimal formation via a streaming instability. Our observation of an exponential cutoff agrees with previous observational inferences that no large objects (\$D \textbackslash gtrsim 400\$ km) exist in the cold population. We note that the asymptotic slope of the \$H\_r\$ distribution is consistent with \$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash sim 0.4\$ and this asymptotic slope is also found in streaming instability modelling of planetesimal formation and is thus not necessarily associated with achieving collisional equilibrium. Studies of the transneptunian region are providing the parameters that will enable future streaming-instability studies to determine the initial conditions of planetesimal formation in the \$\textbackslash approx\$45 au region of the Sun's protoplanetary disk.},

Over the two nights of our observations, prominent emission lines of CH4 and C2H6, along with weaker emission lines of H2O, HCN, CH3OH, and CO were detected. The gas production rate of CO was comparable to that of H2O during the outburst. The mixing ratios of CO, HCN, CH4, C2H6, and CH3OH with respect to H2O were higher than those for normal comets by a factor of five or more. The enrichment of CO and CH4 in comet Hill suggests that the sublimation of these hypervolatiles sustained the outburst of the comet. Some fraction of water in the inner coma might exist as icy grains that were likely ejected from nucleus by the sublimation of hypervolatiles. Mixing ratios of volatiles in comet Hill are indicative of the interstellar heritage without significant alteration in the solar nebula.},

However, the irregular shape and constraints imposed by the fast flyby makes it a challenge to understand these features. Here we use the latest New Horizons shape models of Arrokoth to investigate its geophysical environment, including its surface slopes, gravity field, and moments of inertia\textemdash which are critical context for understanding Arrokoth's formation, evolution, and peculiar geology. We find that Arrokoth's surface features have a complicated relationship to its geophysical environment. For example, bright material tends to be concentrated in geopotential lows (like the neck), consistent with mass wasting\textemdash however, this trend is not consistently observed across Arrokoth. Mass wasting may naturally explain some aspects of Arrokoth's geology, but the actual dynamics of material transport may be complicated owing to Arrokoth's unique shape, spin-rate, and inferred density. While New Horizons's fast and distant flyby precluded directly measuring Arrokoth's mass, we used techniques previously pioneered for comets and asteroids to infer its density. We find that Arrokoth has a low bulk density of {$\rho$} = 235 kg/m{$\mkern1mu$}3 (1{$\sigma$} range: 155\textendash 600 kg/m{$\mkern1mu$}3). This density is low compared to previously explored small bodies, but is comparable to comets, select binary KBOs, and the ring-moons of Saturn. This low density may be a critical data-point for understanding the formation of planetesimals at the dawn of the Solar System.},

Due to the faintness of our targets the detectability rate of a light curve period is \$\textbackslash sim\$56\%, notably lower than in the case of other small body populations, like Hildas or Jovian trojans. We managed to obtain light curve periods with an acceptable confidence for 37 targets; the majority of these cases are new identifications. We were able to give light curve amplitude upper limits for the other 29 targets. Several of the newly detected light curve periods are longer than \$\textbackslash sim\$24 h, in many cases close to \$\textbackslash sim\$80 h, i.e., these targets are slow rotators. This relative abundance of slowly rotating objects is similar to that observed among Hildas, Jovian trojans and Centaurs in the K2 mission, and also among main belt asteroids measured with the TESS Space Telescope. Transneptunian objects show notably higher light curve amplitudes at large (D \$\textbackslash gtrsim\$ 300 km) sizes than that found among large main belt asteroids, in contrast to the general expectation that due to their lower compressive strength they reach hydrostatic equlibrium at smaller sizes than their inner solar system counterparts.},

Through observations of this comet's optical brightness and behavior, we can potentially discern the drivers of activity in the outer solar system. We present a study of the activity of comet Bernardinelli-Bernstein with broad-band optical photometry taken at 19-20 au from the Sun (2021 June to 2022 February) as part of the LCO Outbursting Objects Key (LOOK) Project. Our analysis shows that the comet's optical brightness during this period was initially dominated by cometary outbursts, stochastic events that ejected \$\textbackslash sim10\^7\$ to \$\textbackslash sim10\^8\$ kg of material on short ({$<$} 1 day) timescales. We present evidence for three such outbursts occurring in 2021 June and September. The nominal nuclear volumes excavated by these events are similar to the 10-100 m pit-shaped voids on the surfaces of short-period comet nuclei, as imaged by spacecraft. Two out of three Oort cloud comets observed at large pre-perihelion distances exhibit outburst behavior near 20 au, suggesting such events may be common in this population. In addition, quiescent CO-driven activity may account for the brightness of the comet in 2022 January to February, but that variations in the cometary active area (i.e., the amount of sublimating ice) with heliocentric distance are also possible.},

  abstract = {Main-belt comets are small solar system bodies located in the asteroid belt that repeatedly exhibit comet-like activity (i.e., dust comae or tails) during their perihelion passages, strongly suggesting ice sublimation.1,2 Although the existence of main-belt comets implies the presence of extant water ice in the asteroid belt, no gas has been detected around these objects despite intense scrutiny with the world's largest telescopes.3 Here, we present JWST observations which clearly show that main-belt comet 238P/Read has a coma of water vapour, but lacks a significant CO2 gas coma. Our findings demonstrate that the activity of comet Read is driven by water-ice sublimation, and implies that main-belt comets are fundamentally different from the general cometary population. Whether comet Read experienced different formation circumstances or evolutionary history, it is unlikely to be a recent asteroid belt interloper from the outer solar system. Based on these results, main-belt comets appear to represent a sample of volatile material that is currently unrepresented in observations of classical comets and the meteoritic record, making them important for understanding the early solar system's volatile inventory and its subsequent evolution.},

  abstract = {We describe the digest2 software package, a fast, short-arc orbit classifier for small solar system bodies. The digest2 algorithm has been serving the community for more than 13 yr. The code provides a score, D2, which represents a pseudo-probability that a tracklet belongs to a given solar system orbit type. digest2 is primarily used as a classifier for Near-Earth Object (NEO) candidates, to identify those to be prioritized for follow-up observation. We describe the historical development of digest2 and demonstrate its use on real and synthetic data. We find that digest2 can accurately and precisely distinguish NEOs from non-NEOs. At the time of detection, 14\% of NEO tracklets and 98.5\% of non-NEOs tracklets have D2 below the critical value of D2 = 65.94\% of our simulated NEOs achieved the maximum D2 = 100\% and 99.6\% of NEOs achieved D2  65 at least once during the simulated 10-year timeframe. We demonstrate that D2 varies as a function of time, rate of motion, magnitude and sky-plane location, and show that NEOs tend to have lower D2 at low Solar elongations close to the ecliptic. We use our findings to recommend future development directions for the digest2 code.},

Rapid, automated classification of Roman's microlensing events can be used to prioritize follow-up observations of the most interesting events. Machine learning is now often used for classification problems in astronomy, but the success of such algorithms can rely on the definition of appropriate features that capture essential elements of the observations that can map to parameters of interest. In this paper, we introduce tools that we have developed to capture features in simulated Roman light curves of different types of microlensing events, and we evaluate their effectiveness in classifying microlensing light curves. These features are quantified as parameters that can be used to decide the likelihood that a given light curve is due to a specific type of microlensing event. This method leaves us with a list of parameters that describe features like the smoothness of the peak, symmetry, the number of peaks, and the width and height of small deviations from the main peak. This will allow us to quickly analyze a set of microlensing light curves and later use the resulting parameters as input to machine learning algorithms to classify the events.},

We report new observations of 108P/Ciffreo taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Nordic Optical Telescope and use them to determine the cause of this unusual morphology. The separation and the longevity of the blob across several orbits together rule out the possibility of a single, slow-moving secondary object near the primary nucleus. We use a model of coma particle dynamics under the action of solar gravity and radiation pressure to show that the blob is an artifact of the turnaround of particles ejected sunward and repelled by sunlight. Numerical experiments limit the range of directions which can reproduce the morphology and explain why the comoving blob appearance is rare.},

We find that the mass loss peaks {$<\sptilde$}1 kg/s in 2020 August and then declines to nearly zero over four months. Long-duration mass loss (\textasciitilde 180 days) is consistent with a sublimation origin, indicating that this object is likely an ice-bearing main-belt comet. Equilibrium sublimation of water ice from an area as small as 1580 m\^2 can supply the observed mass loss. Time-series photometry shows tentative evidence for extremely rapid rotation (double-peaked period {$<$} 2 hr) of the small nucleus (effective radius \textasciitilde 420 m). Ejection velocities of 0.1 mm particles are comparable to the 0.3 m/s gravitational escape speed from the nucleus, while larger particles are ejected at speeds less than the escape velocity. These properties are consistent with the sublimation of near-surface ice aided by centripetal acceleration. If water ice sublimation is confirmed, P/2020 O1 would be the icy asteroid with the smallest semimajor axis (highest temperature), setting new bounds on the distribution of ice in the asteroid belt.},

We find that the currently known and currently active MBCs have remarkably similar longitudes of perihelion, which are also aligned with that of Jupiter. The clustered objects have significantly higher current osculating eccentricities relative to their proper eccentricities, consistent with their orbits being currently, though only temporarily, secularly excited in osculating eccentricity due to Jupiter's influence. At the moment, most MBCs seem to have current osculating elements that may be particularly favorable for the object becoming active (e.g., maybe because of higher perihelion temperatures or higher impact velocities causing an effective increase in the size of the potential triggering impactor population). At other times, other icy asteroids will have those favorable conditions and might become MBCs at those times as well.},

  abstract = {Asteroid taxonomies provide a link to surface composition and mineralogy of those objects, although that connection is not fully unique. Currently, one of the most commonly used asteroid taxonomies is that of Bus-DeMeo. The spectral range covering 0.45\textendash 2.45 {$\mu$}m is used to assign a taxonomic class in that scheme. Such observations are only available for a few hundreds of asteroids (out of over one million). On the other hand, a growing amount of space and ground-based surveys delivers multi-filter photometry, which is often used in predicting asteroid types. Those surveys are typically dedicated to studying other astronomical objects, and thus not optimized for asteroid taxonomic classifications. The goal of this study was to quantify the importance and performance of different asteroid spectral features, parameterizations, and methods in predicting the asteroid types. Furthermore, we aimed to identify the key spectral features that can be used to optimize future surveys toward asteroid characterization. Those broad surveys typically are restricted to a few bands; therefore, selecting those that best link them to asteroid taxonomy is crucial in light of maximizing the science output for solar system studies. First, we verified that with the increased number of asteroid spectra, the Bus\textendash DeMeo procedure to create taxonomy still produces the same overall scheme. Second, we confirmed that machine learning methods such as naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting, and multilayer networks can reproduce that taxonomic classification at a high rate of over 81\% balanced accuracy for types and 93\% for complexes. We found that multilayer perceptron with three layers of 32 neurons and stochastic gradient descent solver, batch size of 32, and adaptive learning performed the best in the classification task. Furthermore, the top five features (spectral slope and reflectance at 1.05, 0.9, 0.65, and 1.1 {$\mu$}m) are enough to obtain a balanced accuracy of 93\% for the prediction of complexes and six features (spectral slope and reflectance at 1.4, 1.05, 0.9, 0.95, and 0.65 {$\mu$}m) to obtain 81\% balanced accuracy for taxonomic types. Thus, to optimize future surveys toward asteroid classification, we recommend using filters that cover those features.},

These are the first observations of any Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)-discovered periodic comet by a non-solar observatory and allow us to investigate its behavior under typical cometary circumstances. 322P appeared inactive in all images. Its light curve suggests a rotation period of 2.8 {$\pm$} 0.3 hr and has an amplitude 0.3 mag, implying a density of at least 1000 kg m-3, considerably higher than that of any known comet. It has average colors of g\textcent{} - r\textcent{} = 0.52  0.04 and r\textcent{} - i\textcent{} = 0.03  0.06. We converted these to Johnson colors and found that the V - R color is consistent with average cometary colors, but R - I is somewhat bluer; these colors are most similar to V- and Q-type asteroids. Modeling of the optical and IR photometry suggests it has a diameter of 150\textendash 320 m and a geometric albedo of 0.09\textendash 0.42, with diameter and albedo inversely related. Our upper limits to any undetected coma are still consistent with a sublimation lifetime shorter than the typical dynamical lifetimes for Jupiter-family comets. These results suggest that 322P may be of asteroidal origin and only active in the SOHO fields of view via processes different from the volatile-driven activity of traditional comets. If so, it has the smallest perihelion distance of any known asteroid.},

We now have measurements or constraints on effective radius for over 200 comets, rotation periods for over 60, axial ratios and color indices for over 50, geometric albedos for over 25, and nucleus phase coefficients for over 20. The sample has approximately tripled since the publication of Comets II, with IR surveys using Spitzer and NEOWISE responsible for the bulk of the increase in effective radii measurements. Advances in coma morphology studies and long-term studies of a few prominent comets have resulted in meaningful constraints on rotation period changes in nearly a dozen comets, allowing this to be added to the range of nucleus properties studied. The first delay-Doppler radar and visible light polarimetric measurements of comet nuclei have been made since Comets II and are considered alongside the traditional methods of studying nuclei remotely. We use the results from recent in situ missions, notably Rosetta, to put the collective properties obtained by remote observations into context, emphasizing the insights gained into surface properties and the prevalence of highly elongated and/or bilobate shapes. We also explore how nucleus properties evolve, focusing on fragmentation and the likely related phenomena of outbursts and disintegration. Knowledge of these behaviors has been shaped in recent years by diverse sources: high resolution images of nucleus fragmentation and disruption events, the detection of thousands of small comets near the Sun, regular photometric monitoring of large numbers of comets throughout the solar system, and detailed imaging of the surfaces of mission targets. Finally, we explore what advances in the knowledge of the bulk nucleus properties may be enabled in coming years.},

The asteroid showed cometary activity signs such as a dust coma and a tail, the presence of which was confirmed by the morphology analysis. The apparent and absolute magnitudes of the asteroid in the R band were measured. The absolute magnitude gradual decrease from 13.97 to 14.53 showed the activity decline during the observation period. The dust production rate decrease towards the end of the observation period also confirms the ceasing of the object's activity. We estimated the upper limit of the diameter of the asteroid as \$7 km which is consistent with the available data. The new data support a cometary nature of the object. The equatorial coordinates of the asteroid were determined. The accuracy of astrometric measurements made it possible to calculate the orbit, the elements of which were consistent with the available orbital data. The asteroid activity did not affect the stability of the orbit.},

  abstract = {Rotational spin-up due to outgassing of comet nuclei has been identified as a possible mechanism for considerable mass-loss and splitting. We report a search for spin changes for three large Jupiter-family comets (JFCs): 14P/Wolf, 143P/Kowal-Mrkos, and 162P/Siding Spring. None of the three comets has detectable period changes, and we set conservative upper limits of 4.2 (14P), 6.6 (143P), and 25 (162P) min per orbit. Comparing these results with all eight other JFCs with measured rotational changes, we deduce that none of the observed large JFCs experiences significant spin changes. This suggests that large comet nuclei are less likely to undergo rotationally driven splitting, and therefore more likely to survive more perihelion passages than smaller nuclei. We find supporting evidence for this hypothesis in the cumulative size distributions of JFCs and dormant comets, as well as in recent numerical studies of cometary orbital dynamics. We added 143P to the sample of 13 other JFCs with known albedos and phase-function slopes. This sample shows a possible correlation of increasing phase-function slopes for larger geometric albedos. Partly based on findings from recent space missions to JFCs, we hypothesize that this correlation corresponds to an evolutionary trend for JFCs. We propose that newly activated JFCs have larger albedos and steeper phase functions, which gradually decrease due to sublimation-driven erosion. If confirmed, this could be used to analyse surface erosion from ground and to distinguish between dormant comets and asteroids.},

They were observed in the period 2004\textendash 2015 with various ground telescopes as part of the Survey of Ensemble Physical Properties of Cometary Nuclei as well as during devoted observing campaigns. We add to this a review of the properties of 35 JFCs with previously published rotation properties. The photometric time series were obtained in Bessel R, Harris R and SDSS r filters and were absolutely calibrated using stars from the Pan-STARRS survey. This specially developed method allowed us to combine data sets taken at different epochs and instruments with absolute-calibration uncertainty down to 0.02 mag. We used the resulting time series to improve the rotation periods for comets 14P/Wolf, 47P/Ashbrook\textendash Jackson, 94P/Russell and 110P/Hartley 3 and to determine the rotation rates of comets 93P/Lovas and 162P/Siding Spring for the first time. In addition to this, we determined the phase functions for seven of the examined comets and derived geometric albedos for eight of them. We confirm the known cut-off in bulk densities at {$\sim$}0.6 g cm-3 if JFCs are strengthless. Using a model for prolate ellipsoids with typical density and elongations, we conclude that none of the known JFCs requires tensile strength larger than 10\textendash 25 Pa to remain stable against rotational instabilities. We find evidence for an increasing linear phase function coefficient with increasing geometric albedo. The median linear phase function coefficient for JFCs is 0.046 mag deg-1 and the median geometric albedo is 4.2 per cent.},

  abstract = {As of April 2010, 48 TNO (trans-Neptunian Object) binaries have been found. This is about 6\% of known TNOs. However, in previous theoretical studies of planetary formation in the TNO region, the effect of binary formation has been neglected. TNO binaries can be formed through a variety of mechanisms, such as a three-body process, dynamical friction on two massive bodies, inelastic collisions between two bodies etc. Most of these mechanisms become more effective as the distance from the Sun increases. In this paper, we describe our study on three-body process using direct N -body simulations. We found that chaos-assisted-capture (CAC) is the dominant channel of binary formation. We systematically changed the distance from the Sun, the number density of planetesimals, and the radius of the planetesimals and studied the effect of the binaries on the collision rate of planetesimals. In the TNO region, binaries are involved in 1=3\textendash 1=2 of collisions, and the collision rate increases by a factor of a few compared to the theoretical estimate for direct two-body collisions. Thus, it is possible that the binaries significantly enhance the collision rate and reduce the growth timescale. In the terrestrial planet region, binaries are less important, because the ratio between the Hill radius and the physical size of the planetesimals is relatively small. Although the time scale of our simulations is short, they clearly demonstrated that the accretion process in the TNO region is quite different from that in the terrestrial planet region.},

  abstract = {Binary solar system objects are common and range from satellite systems with very large mass ratios \$M\_1/M\_2\$ to mass ratios very close to unity. A well-known example of a binary is the Pluto-Charon system. With Charon only eight times less massive than Pluto the question arises as for many other systems, why the mass-ratio is still close to unity. There is much evidence that (binary) planet(esimal) formation happened early, when the protoplanetary gas disk was still around. It is likely that (some of) these binaries grew up together subject to pebble accretion. Here we focus on the question of how the mass arriving in the gravitational influence zone of the binary during pebble accretion, is distributed over the binary components. Does the accretion through time lead to a converging mass ratio, or to a diverging mass ratio? We numerically integrate pebble paths in the same well-known fashion as for a single mass subject to pebble accretion and track what the efficiency of accretion is for the two separate binary components, compared to a single body with the same mass. These numerical simulations are done for a range of binary mass-ratios, mutual separations, Stokes numbers and two orbital distances, 2.5 and 39 au. We find that in the limit where pebbles start to spiral around the primary (this holds for relatively large pebbles), the pebble preferentially collides with the secondary, causing the mass ratio to converge towards unity on Myr timescales. In this regime the total sweep-up efficiency can lower to half that of a pebble-accreting single body because pebbles that are thrown out of the system, after close encounters with the system. The results show that systems such as Pluto-Charon and other larger equal mass binaries could well have co-accreted by means of pebble accretion in the disk phase without producing binaries with highly diverging mass-ratios.},

  abstract = {Chemical and mineral compositions of asteroids reflect the formation and history of our Solar System. This knowledge is also important for planetary defence and in-space resource utilisation. We aim to develop a fast and robust neural-network-based method for deriving the mineral modal and chemical compositions of silicate materials from their visible and near-infrared spectra. The method should be able to process raw spectra without significant pre-processing. We designed a convolutional neural network with two hidden layers for the analysis of the spectra, and trained it using labelled reflectance spectra. For the training, we used a dataset that consisted of reflectance spectra of real silicate samples stored in the RELAB and C-Tape databases, namely olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, their mixtures, and olivine-pyroxene-rich meteorites. We used the model on two datasets. First, we evaluated the model reliability on a test dataset where we compared the model classification with known compositional reference values. The individual classification results are mostly within 10 percentage-point intervals around the correct values. Second, we classified the reflectance spectra of S-complex (Q-type and V-type, also including A-type) asteroids with known Bus-DeMeo taxonomy classes. The predicted mineral chemical composition of S-type and Q-type asteroids agree with the chemical composition of ordinary chondrites. The modal abundances of V-type and A-type asteroids show a dominant contribution of orthopyroxene and olivine, respectively. Additionally, our predictions of the mineral modal composition of S-type and Q-type asteroids show an apparent depletion of olivine related to the attenuation of its diagnostic absorptions with space weathering. This trend is consistent with previous results of the slower pyroxene response to space weathering relative to olivine.},

During this period the comet was on the outbound segment of its orbit, between heliocentric distances of 8.36 au and 16.84 au. Analysis of the spectra revealed the presence of the CO+ and N\th 2 emissions in the cometary coma at a distance of 8.36 au from the Sun. This distance is larger than ionic emissions have been detected in any previous objects. Only continuum, with no traces of emissions, was detected in the spectrum obtained in 2009 when the comet was at a distance of 9.86 au. From the spectra obtained in 2008, average column densities of 2.04 \^A 109 mol cm\`A2 for N\th 2 and 3.26 \^A 1010 mol cm\`A2 for CO+ were measured in the cometary coma. The derived values correspond to N\th 2 =CO\th{} {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0:06 within the projected slit. Images obtained through a red continuum filter in 2008 showed a bright, dust coma, indicating a high level of physical activity. A considerably lower level of activity was observed in 2009 and 2011 at distances of 9.86 au and 13.40 au respectively. No noticeable activity was detected in 2013 at a heliocentric distance of 16.84 au. The Afq parameter, which is used as an indicator of cometary activity, was measured as 2000 cm in 2008, and 800 cm in 2009 and 2011. The Afq values correspond to dust production rates between 10\textendash 20 kg s\`A1, 4\textendash 6 kg s\`A1 and 3\textendash 5 kg s\`A1 at 8.36, 9.86, and 13.40 au respectively. There is an obvious correlation between the decrease of the dust production rate of the nucleus and the disappearance of the emissions in the spectrum of C/2002 VQ94 (LINEAR) at heliocentric distances greater than 9 au. The colors and size of the nucleus of C/2002 VQ94 (LINEAR) were estimated from the images obtained during the late stage at a heliocentric distance of 16.84 au, when the activity had probable ceased.

By applying the FLI map method to the 8:3 MMR region in the orbital plane of Ceres, we were able to distinguish between stable and unstable orbits. Subsequently, based on the FLI maps (for mean anomaly M = 60{$\smwhtcircle$} and also M = 30{$\smwhtcircle$}), 500 of the most stable and 500 of the most unstable particles were integrated for 15 M yr for each map. Long-term integration in the case of M = 60{$\smwhtcircle$} showed that most of the stable particles evolved, in general, in uneventful ways with only 0.8\% of particles reaching the limit of q {$\leq$} 1.3 AU . However, in the case of M = 30{$\smwhtcircle$}, a stable evolution was not confirmed. Over 40\% of particles reached orbits with q {$\leq$} 1.3 AU and numerous particles were ejected to hyperbolic orbits or orbits with a {$>$} 100 AU . The results for stable particles indicate that short-term FLI maps are more suitable for finding chaotic orbits, than for detecting the stable ones. A rough estimate shows that it is possible for material released from Ceres to get to the region of 8:3 MMR with Jupiter. A long-term integration of unstable particles in both cases showed that transportation of material via 8:3 MMR close to the Earth is possible.},

When the ratio of the semi-major axes of the asteroid and Jupiter takes a very small value, the solutions are expressed by elliptic functions. When the z component of the angular momentum (that is, Delaunay's H) of the asteroid is smaller than a certain limiting value, there are both a stationary solution and solutions corresponding to libration cases. The limiting value of H increases as the ratio of the semimajor axes increases, i.e., the corresponding limiting inclination drops from 39.2\textdegree{} to 1.8\textdegree{} as the ratio of the axes increases from 0.0 to 0.95.},

  abstract = {Outer main belt asteroid (223) Rosa is a possible flyby target of opportunity for ESA's (European Space Agency) JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) mission when passing the asteroid belt on the way to Jupiter. The very low albedo and the featureless red spectra indicate a P-type asteroid in the Tholen taxonomy, though the yet known bulk density did not match very well this classification. Aim of this work was to derive new estimates for the mass and for the bulk density for (223) Rosa. The mass of Rosa was derived by analyzing the gravitational deflection of small `test' asteroids which had a close encounter with Rosa in the past. To find such events suitable for the mass determination, an encounter search with about 900,000 asteroids over the time span \$1980-2030\$ was performed. Three encounters were identified from which two independent mass estimates for Rosa were derived: \$M = (5.32 \textbackslash pm 2.17) \textbackslash times 10\^\{17\}\$ kg and \$M = (3.15 \textbackslash pm 1.14) \textbackslash times 10\^\{17\}\$ kg, respectively. The weighted mean is \$M = (3.62 \textbackslash pm 1.25) \textbackslash times 10\^\{17\}\$ kg. This yields to a bulk density of \$\textbackslash rho = 1.2 \textbackslash pm 0.5 \textbackslash mathrm\{\textbackslash,g\textbackslash,cm\^\{-3\}\}\$, when adopting an effective diameter of \$D = 83 \textbackslash pm 8\$ km. This bulk density estimate is consistent with typical densities for Tholen taxonomy P-type asteroids.},

  abstract = {Large and publicly available astronomical archives open up new possibilities to search and study Solar System objects. However, advanced techniques are required to deal with the large amounts of data. These unbiased surveys can be used to constrain the size distribution of minor bodies, which represents a piece of the puzzle for the formation models of the Solar System. We aim to identify asteroids in archival images from the ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Science data archive using data mining. We developed a citizen science project on the Zooniverse platform, Hubble Asteroid Hunter (www.asteroidhunter.org) asking members of the public to identify asteroid trails in archival HST images. We used the labels provided by the volunteers to train an automated deep learning model built with Google Cloud AutoML Vision to explore the entire HST archive to detect asteroids crossing the field-of-view. We report the detection of 1701 new asteroid trails identified in archival HST data via our citizen science project and the subsequent machine learning exploration of the ESA HST science data archive. We detect asteroids to a magnitude of 24.5, which are statistically fainter than the populations of asteroids identified from ground-based surveys. The majority of asteroids are distributed near the ecliptic plane, as expected, where we find an approximate density of 80 asteroids per square degree. We match 670 trails (39\% of the trails found) with 454 known Solar System objects in the Minor Planet Center database, however, no matches are found for 1031 (61\%) trails. The unidentified asteroids are faint, being on average 1.6 magnitudes fainter than the asteroids we succeeded to identify. They probably correspond to previously unknown objects. This work demonstrates that citizen science and machine learning are useful techniques for the systematic search of SSOs in existing astronomy science archives.},

A reliable statistical analysis of the spin vectors is now possible. In general the poles (both for MB bodies and for NEAs) are not isotropically distributed, as some general theoretical considerations may predict. Main belt asteroids show a lack of poles close to the ecliptic plane. There is a marginally significant excess of prograde spinners in the 100\textendash 150 km size range, but interestingly there is not a statistically significant excess in the larger size range. Among NEAs, there is an excess of retrograde rotations. The distributions of longitudes of poles of both groups do not show statistically significant deviations from random. We discuss the possible physical implications of the various resulting pole anisotropies in terms of dynamical\textemdash mainly non-gravitational\textemdash effects, and point out the importance of new observational campaigns, mainly devoted to compute the poles of small bodies and of the members of asteroid dynamical families.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            (155140) 2005 UD has a similar orbit to (3200) Phaethon, an active asteroid in a highly eccentric orbit thought to be the source of the Geminid meteor shower. Evidence points to a genetic relationship between these two objects, but we have yet to fully understand how 2005 UD and Phaethon could have separated into this associated pair. Presented herein are new observations of 2005 UD from five observatories that were carried out during the 2018, 2019, and 2021 apparitions. We implemented light curve inversion using our new data, as well as dense and sparse archival data from epochs in 2005\textendash 2021, to better constrain the rotational period and derive a convex shape model of 2005 UD. We discuss two equally well-fitting pole solutions (               {$\lambda$}               = 116.\textdegree 6,               {$\beta$}               = -53.\textdegree 6) and (               {$\lambda$}               = 300.\textdegree 3,               {$\beta$}               = -55.\textdegree 4), the former largely in agreement with previous thermophysical analyses and the latter interesting due to its proximity to Phaethon's pole orientation. We also present a refined sidereal period of               P               sid               = 5.234246 {$\pm$} 0.000097 hr. A search for surface color heterogeneity showed no significant rotational variation. An activity search using the deepest stacked image available of 2005 UD near aphelion did not reveal a coma or tail but allowed modeling of an upper limit of 0.04\textendash 0.37 kg s               -1               for dust production. We then leveraged our spin solutions to help limit the range of formation scenarios and the link to Phaethon in the context of nongravitational forces and timescales associated with the physical evolution of the system.},

The emissions CN 0\textendash 0, 0\textendash 1 (B2{$\Sigma$}+ - X2{$\Sigma$}+), C3 (A1{$\Pi$}u - X1{$\Sigma$}g+) bands and C2 0\textendash 0 (A3{$\Pi$}g \textendash{} X3{$\Pi$}u) of the Swan band system were identified in the post-perihelion cometary spectrum. Using the simple Haser model, the gas production rates of CN, C2 and C3 molecules were estimated at level of 1.35 \texttimes{} 1024 mol/s, 0.45 \texttimes{} 1024 mol/s, and 0.12 \texttimes{} 1024 mol/s, respectively. The gas production rate ratios, log(C2/CN) = - 0.48 and log(C3/CN) = - 1.05, point out that comet C/2006 OF2 probably belongs to the group of ``carbonchain depleted'' comets. The ratios between C2, C3 and CN abundances of comet C/2006 OF2 are similar to those recently measured for interstellar comet 2I/Borisov at comparable heliocentric distances. The normalized reflectivity gradients of 12.7 {$\pm$} 0.2\%/1000 \AA{} and - 2.3 {$\pm$} 0.2\%/1000 \AA{} were calculated from the post perihelion spectrum in the intervals 4450 \AA{} \textendash{} 5500 \AA{} and 5500\textendash 6935 \AA, respectively, using the spectral regions free from comet emissions. The continuum slope, measured in the interval 4200 \AA{} \textendash{} 4800 \AA, is even steeper, reaching 32.7 {$\pm$} 0.2\%/1000 \AA. The normalized reflectivity gradient measured from a pair of the pre-perihelion V and R-images varies between 8\%/1000 \AA{} and 11\%/1000 \AA{} in the inner part of the coma, which exceeds the value obtained from the similar spectral interval of the post-perihelion spectrum, indicating that the coma became bluer after the perihelion passage. The morphology of the pre-perihelion images of the comet is governed by faint morpho\- logical features hidden in the bright coma. The color of the jets isolated from the pre-perihelion images is redder than the color of the ambient coma. The pre- and post-perihelion V-band Af{$\rho$} parameters were found to be 1990 {$\pm$} 90 cm and 2500 {$\pm$} 100 cm for heliocentric distances of 4.24 au and 2.59 au, respectively.},

  abstract = {Volatile compositions of asteroids provide information on the Solar System history and the origins of Earth's volatiles. Visible to near-infrared observations at wavelengths of {$<$} 2.5 \textmu m have suggested a genetic link between outer main belt asteroids located at 2.5\textendash 4 au and carbonaceous chondrite meteorites (CCs) that show isotopic similarities to volatile elements on Earth. However, recent longer wavelength data for large outer main belt asteroids show 3.1 \textmu m absorption features of ammoniated phyllosilicates that are absent in CCs and cannot easily form from materials stable at those present distances. Here, by combining data collected by the AKARI space telescope and hydrological, geochemical, and spectral models of water-rock reactions, we show that the surface materials of asteroids having 3.1 \textmu m absorption features and CCs can originate from different regions of a single, water-rock-differentiated parent body. Ammoniated phyllosilicates form within the water-rich mantles of the differentiated bodies containing NH3 and CO2 under high water-rock ratios ({$>$} 4) and low temperatures ({$<$} 70{$\smwhtcircle$}C). CCs can originate from the rock-dominated cores, that are likely to be preferentially sampled as meteorites by disruption and transport processes. Our results suggest that multiple large main belt asteroids formed beyond the NH3 and CO2 snow lines (currently {$>$} 10 au) and could be transported to their current locations. Earth's high hydrogen to carbon ratio may be explained by accretion of these water-rich progenitors.},

We observed it photometrically from 2 March, when it was visible at V = 16.5 mag, until 7 March (V = 18.2 mag). During that time 2021 DW1 swept a 170{$\smwhtcircle$} long arc in the northern sky, spanning solar phase angles in the range from 36{$\smwhtcircle$} to 86{$\smwhtcircle$}. This made it an excellent target for physical characterisation, including spin axis and shape derivation. Results. Convex inversion of the asteroid lightcurves gives a sidereal period of rotation Psid = 0.013760 {$\pm$} 0.000001 h, and two solutions for the spin axis ecliptic coordinates: (A) {$\lambda$}1 = 57{$\smwhtcircle$} {$\pm$} 10{$\smwhtcircle$}, {$\beta$}1 = 29{$\smwhtcircle$} {$\pm$} 10{$\smwhtcircle$}, and (B) {$\lambda$}2 = 67{$\smwhtcircle$} {$\pm$} 10{$\smwhtcircle$}, {$\beta$}2 = -40{$\smwhtcircle$} {$\pm$} 10{$\smwhtcircle$}. The magnitude-phase curve can be fitted with a standard H, G function with H = 24.8 {$\pm$} 0.5 mag and an assumed G = 0.24. The asteroid colour indices are g-i = 0.79{$\pm$}0.01 mag, and i-z = 0.01{$\pm$}0.02 mag which indicates an S taxonomic class, with an average geometric albedo pV = 0.23 {$\pm$} 0.02. The asteroid effective diameter, derived from H and pV , is Deff = 30 {$\pm$} 10 m. Conclusions. It was found that the inclination of the spin axis of 2021 DW1 is not perpendicular to the orbital plane (obliquity = 54{$\smwhtcircle$} {$\pm$} 10{$\smwhtcircle$} or = 123{$\smwhtcircle$} {$\pm$} 10{$\smwhtcircle$}).

  abstract = {We report our new analysis of Oort-cloud comet C/2020 T2 (Palomar) (T2) observed at 2.06 au from the Sun (phase angle of 28.5 deg) about two weeks before perihelion. T2 lacks a significant dust tail in scattered light, showing a strong central condensation of the coma throughout the apparition, reminiscent of so-called Manx comets. Its spectral slope of polarized light increases and decreases in the J (1.25 um) and H (1.65 um) bands, respectively, resulting in an overall negative (blue) slope (-0.31+/-0.14 \% um\^-1) in contrast to the red polarimetric color of active comets observed at similar geometries. The average polarization degree of T2 is 2.86+/-0.17 \% for the J and 2.75+/-0.16 \% for the H bands. Given that near-infrared wavelengths are sensitive to the intermediate-scale structure of cometary dust (i.e., dust aggregates), our light-scattering modeling of ballistic aggregates with different porosities and compositions shows that polarimetric properties of T2 are compatible with low-porosity (\textasciitilde 66 \%), absorbing dust aggregates with negligible ice contents on a scale of 10--100 um (density of \textasciitilde 652 kg m\^-3). This is supported by the coma morphology of T2 which has a viable beta (the relative importance of solar radiation pressure on dust) range of {$<\sptilde$}10\^-4. Secular evolution of the r-band activity of T2 from archival data reveals that the increase in its brightness accelerates around 2.4 au pre-perihelion, with its overall dust production rate \textasciitilde 100 times smaller than those of active Oort-cloud comets. We also found an apparent concentration of T2 and Manx comets toward ecliptic orbits. This paper underlines the heterogeneous nature of Oort-cloud comets which can be investigated in the near future with dedicated studies of their dust characteristics.},

We performed spectroscopic observations of two T-type asteroids, (96) Aegle and (570) Kythera, over 2.8--4.0 \$\textbackslash mu\$m using the Subaru telescope. With other T-types' spectra available in the literature and survey datasets, we strove to find commonalities and global trends in this group. We also utilised the asteroids' polarimetric data and meteorite spectra to constrain their surface texture and composition. Our targets exhibit red \$L\$-band continuum slopes similar to (1) Ceres and 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and have an OH-absorption feature with band centres \${$<\$$}2.8 \$\textbackslash mu\$m. (96) Aegle hints at a shallow N--H band near 3.1 \$\textbackslash mu\$m and C--H band of organic materials over 3.4--3.6 \$\textbackslash mu\$m, whereas no diagnostic bands of water ice and other volatiles exceeding the noise of the data were seen for both asteroids. The large T-type asteroids but (596) Scheila display similar spectral shapes to our targets. \$\textbackslash sim\$50 \textbackslash\% of large T-types contain an absorption band near 0.6--0.65 \$\textbackslash mu\$m likely associated with hydrated minerals. For T-type asteroids (except Jupiter Trojans) of all sizes, we found a weak correlation: the smaller the diameter and the closer the Sun, the redder the visible slope. The 2.9-\$\textbackslash mu\$m band depths of large T-types suggest that they might have experienced aqueous alteration comparable to Ch-types but more intense than most of the main-belt asteroids. The polarimetric phase curve of the T-types is well described by a particular surface structure and their 0.5--4.0 \$\textbackslash mu\$m reflectance spectra appear most similar to CI chondrites with grain sizes of \$\textbackslash sim\$25--35 \$\textbackslash mu\$m. Taken as a whole, we propose that large T-type asteroids might be dislodged roughly around 10 au in the early solar system.},

  abstract = {Asteroids having perihelion distance \$q\$ \${$<\$$} 1.3 AU are classified as near-Earth objects (NEOs), which are divided into different sub-groups: Vatira-class, Atira-class, Aten-class, Apollo-class, and Amor-class. 2020 \$AV\_2\$, the first Vatira (Orbiting totally inside Venus' orbit) was discovered by the Twilight project of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) on January 4, 2020. Upon the discovery of 2020 \$AV\_2\$, a couple of orbital studies of the short-term orbital evolution of 2020 \$AV\_2\$ have been performed and published (e.g. de la Fuente Marcos \& de la Fuente Marcos 2020; Greenstreet 2020). In this present work, we performed an assessment of the long-term orbital evolution of known near-Earth objects and known Atiras under the Yarkovsky effect by using the \textbackslash textit\{Mercury6\} N-body code. We considered not only planetary gravitational perturbation but also the non-gravitational Yarkovsky effect. Our calculation shows that the NEOs have generally two dynamical populations, one short-lived and the other long-lived. From our calculation, the transfer probabilities of Atira-class asteroids to Vatira-class asteroids for the first transition are \$\textbackslash sim\$13.1 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.400, \$\textbackslash sim\$13.05 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.005, and \$\textbackslash sim\$ 13.25 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.450 \$\textbackslash\%\$ for different values of the Yarkovsky force (i.e. obliquity of 0, 90, and 180 deg.), respectively. It suggests that the radiation force may play some role in the long-term evolution of this asteroid population. Finally, our statistical study implicates that there should be 8.14 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.133 Atira-class asteroids and 1.05 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.075 Vatira-asteroids of the S-type taxonomy.},

After deployment of the sunshield on January 6 2022, the 6-h lightcurve has a significant amplitude and shows small variations due to the artificial rotation of the space telescope during commissionning. These variations could be due to the deployment of the primary mirror or some changes in orientation of the space telescope. This work illustrates the power of a worldwide array of small telescopes, operated by citizen astronomers, to conduct large scientific campaigns over a long timeframe. In the future, our network and others will continue to monitor JWST to detect potential degradations to the space environment by comparing the evolution of the lightcurve.},

Three solutions accurately capture the vast majority of the rotational frequencies in our sample: the best-fit frequency and its mirrors around 3.78 and 7.57 rotations per day. By comparing our solutions to a high-quality control group of 752 asteroid spin periods, we found that one of our solutions is accurate (within 5\%) in 88\% of the cases.

This has been interpreted as the outcome of the early stages of planet formation, indicative of a picture in which planets form at characteristic mass scales with uniform separations. In this paper, we argue instead that intra-system uniformity in planet sizes and orbital spacings likely arose from the long-term dynamical sculpting of initially-overly-packed planetary systems (in other words, the giant impact phase). With a suite of \$N\$-body simulations, we demonstrate that systems with random initial masses and compact planet spacings naturally develop intra-system uniformity, in quantitative agreement with observations, due to collisions between planets. Our results suggest that the pre-giant impact planet mass distribution is fairly wide and provide evidence for the prevalence of dynamical sculpting in shaping the observed population of exoplanets.},

During cycle 9 (2000 July to 2001 June), we performed multi-orbit observations of 10 ecliptic comets with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2. Nominally, eight contiguous orbits covering a time interval of {$\sim$}11 h were devoted to each comet but a few orbits were occasionally lost. In addition to the standard R band, we could additionally observe four of them in the V band and the two brightest ones in the B band. Time series photometry was used to constrain the size, shape and rotational period of the 10 nuclei. Assuming a geometric albedo of 0.04 for the R band, a linear phase law with a coefficient of 0.04 mag deg-1 and an opposition effect similar to that of comet 19P/Borrelly, we determined the following mean values of the effective radii 47P/Ashbrook\textendash Jackson: 2.86{$\pm$}0.08 km, 61P/Shajn\textendash Schaldach: 0.62{$\pm$}0.02 km, 70P/Kojima: 1.83{$\pm$}0.05 km, 74P/Smirnova\textendash Chernykh: 2.23{$\pm$}0.04 km, 76P/West\textendash Kohoutek\textendash Ikemura: 0.30{$\pm$}0.02 km, 82P/Gehrels 3: 0.69{$\pm$}0.02 km, 86P/Wild 3: 0.41{$\pm$}0.03 km, 87P/Bus: 0.270.01 km, 110P/Hartley 3: 2.15{$\pm$}0.04 km and 147P/Kushida\textendash Muramatsu: 0.21{$\pm$}0.01 km. Because of the limited time coverage ({$\sim$}11 h), the rotational periods could not be accurately determined, multiple solutions were sometime found and three periods were not constrained at all. Our estimates range from {$\sim$}5 to {$\sim$}32 h. The lower limits for the ratio a/b of the semi-axis of the equivalent spheroids range from 1.10 (70P) to 2.20 (87P). The four nuclei for which we could measure (V - R) are all significantly redder than the Sun, with 86P/Wild 3 (V - R) = 0.86 {$\pm$} 0.10 appearing as an ultrared object.

  abstract = {We critically review the data on the sizes, shapes, albedos, and colors of cometary nuclei. Reliable sizes have been determined for 65 ecliptic comets (ECs) and 13 nearly isotropic comets (NICs). The effective radii fall in the range 0.2-15 km for the ECs and 1.6-37 km for the NICs. We note that several nuclei recently measured by the Hubble Space Telescope are subkilometer in radius, and that only 5 of the 65 well-measured EC nuclei have effective radii larger than 5 km. We estimate that the cumulative size distribution (CSD) of the ECs obeys a single power law with an exponent qS = 1.9 {$\pm$} 0.3 down to a radius of \textasciitilde 1.6 km. Below this value there is an apparent deficiency of nuclei, possibly owing to observational bias and/or mass loss. When augmented by 21 near-Earth objects (NEOs) that are thought to be extinct ECs, the CSD flattens to qS = 1.6 {$\pm$} 0.2. The cumulative size distribution of NICs remains ill-defined because of the limited statistical basis compared to ECs. The axial ratios a/b of the measured nuclei of ECs have a median value of \textasciitilde 1.5 and rarely exceed a value of 2, although it must be noted that the observed a/b values are often lower limits because of uncertainties in the aspect angle. The range of rotational periods extends from 5 to 70 h. The lower limit is significantly larger than that of main-belt asteroids and NEOs (\textasciitilde 2.2 h, excluding the monolithic fast rotators), and this has implications for the bulk density of cometary nuclei. By combining rotation and shape data when available, we find a lower limit of 0.6 g cm-3 for the nucleus bulk density to ensure stability against centrifugal disruption. Cometary nuclei are very dark objects with globally averaged albedos falling within a very restricted range: 0.02-0.06, and possibly even narrower. (B-V), (V-R), and (R-I) color indices indicate that, on average, the color of cometary nuclei is redder than the color of the Sun. There is, however, a large diversity of colors, ranging from slightly blue to very red. While two comets have well-characterized phase functions with a slope of 0.04 mag deg-1, there is evidence for steeper (2P/Encke, 48P/Johnson) and shallower (28P/Neujmin 1) functions, so that the observed range is 0.025-0.06 mag deg-1. The study of the physical properties of cometary nuclei is still in its infancy, with many unresolved issues, but significant progress is expected in the near future from current and new facilities, both groundbased and spaceborne.},

A total of 26 comets, from a variety of dynamical families, were observed on 39 different nights from 1996 to 2007. A new statistical method extracted the twilight sky from comet frames, because traditional sky subtraction techniques were inadequate. Because previously published Haser model parent and daughter scale lengths did not fit the data well, unbiased ranges of scale lengths were searched for the best-fitting pairs. Coma gas production rates for OH, CN, C2, C3, NH, NH2, and OH confirmed the widely reported carbon-chain depletion for a sub-class of comets, most notably high-perihelion Jupiter-family comets observed at rh {$>$} 1.5 AU, with different behaviors for C2 and C3. Our long-slit spectroscopy data was also adapted for the A(h)fq dust production parameter. The assumption that A(h)fq is constant throughout the nucleus was not upheld. High dust-to-gas ratios for comets with large perihelia were not a selection effect, and suggest that the dust was released earlier in the formation of the coma than the gas. The dust-to-gas ratio did not exhibit any evolutionary traces between different comet dynamical families. The comet survey illuminates the diversity among comets, including the unusually carbon poor Comet 96P/Machholz.},

The transient survey is performed using a new 8.1 square degree camera installed on the 48 inch Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory; colors and light curves for detected transients are obtained with the automated Palomar 60 inch telescope. PTF uses 80\% of the 1.2 m and 50\% of the 1.5 m telescope time. With an exposure of 60 s the survey reaches a depth of mg0 {$\approx$} 21:3 and mR {$\approx$} 20:6 (5{$\sigma$}, median seeing). Four major experiments are planned for the five-year project: (1) a 5 day cadence supernova search; (2) a rapid transient search with cadences between 90 s and 1 day; (3) a search for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets in Orion; and (4) a 3{$\pi$} sr deep H-alpha survey. PTF provides automatic, real-time transient classification and follow-up, as well as a database including every source detected in each frame. This paper summarizes the PTF project, including several months of on-sky performance tests of the new survey camera, the observing plans, and the data reduction strategy. We conclude by detailing the first 51 PTF optical transient detections, found in commissioning data.},

Our aim was to use photometric data from the apparitions in 2020-2021 to refine the shape model and spin state of Apophis. Methods. Using thirty-six 1 to 2-m class ground-based telescopes and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we performed a photometric observation campaign throughout the 2020-2021 apparition. The convex shape model and spin state were refined using the light-curve inversion method. Results. According to our best-fit model, Apophis is rotating in a short axis mode with rotation and precession periods of 264.178 hours and 27.38547 hours, respectively. The angular momentum vector orientation of Apophis was found as (275\$\^\textbackslash circ\$, -85\$\^\textbackslash circ\$) in the ecliptic coordinate system. The ratio of the dynamic moments of inertia of this asteroid was fitted to \$I\_a:I\_b:I\_c=0.64:0.97:1\$, which corresponds to an elongated prolate ellipsoid. These findings regarding the spin state and shape model could be used to not only design the space mission scenario but also investigate the impact of the Earth's tidal force during close encounters.},

  abstract = {Collisions are the core agent of planet formation. In this work, we derive an analytic description of the dynamical outcome for any collision between gravity-dominated bodies. We conduct high-resolution simulations of collisions between planetesimals; the results are used to isolate the effects of different impact parameters on collision outcome. During growth from planetesimals to planets, collision outcomes span multiple regimes: cratering, merging, disruption, super-catastrophic disruption, and hit-and-run events. We derive equations (scaling laws) to demarcate the transition between collision regimes and to describe the size and velocity distributions of the postcollision bodies. The scaling laws are used to calculate maps of collision outcomes as a function of mass ratio, impact angle, and impact velocity, and we discuss the implications of the probability of each collision regime during planet formation. Collision outcomes are described in terms of the impact conditions and the catastrophic disruption criteria, Q{${_\ast}$}RD\textemdash the specific energy required to disperse half the total colliding mass. All planet formation and collisional evolution studies have assumed that catastrophic disruption follows pure energy scaling; however, we find that catastrophic disruption follows nearly pure momentum scaling. As a result, Q{${_\ast}$}RD is strongly dependent on the impact velocity and projectile-to-target mass ratio in addition to the total mass and impact angle. To account for the impact angle, we derive the interacting mass fraction of the projectile; the outcome of a collision is dependent on the kinetic energy of the interacting mass rather than the kinetic energy of the total mass. We also introduce a new material parameter, c{${_\ast}$}, that defines the catastrophic disruption criteria between equal-mass bodies in units of the specific gravitational binding energy. For a diverse range of planetesimal compositions and internal structures, c{${_\ast}$} has a value of 5 {$\pm$} 2; whereas for strengthless planets, we find c{${_\ast}$} = 1.9 {$\pm$} 0.3. We refer to the catastrophic disruption criteria for equal-mass bodies as the principal disruption curve, which is used as the reference value in the calculation of Q{${_\ast}$}RD for any collision scenario. The analytic collision model presented in this work will significantly improve the physics of collisions in numerical simulations of planet formation and collisional evolution.},

Detection of gases is expected in the upcoming years as the comet is heading towards a \textasciitilde 11 au perihelion in 2031. We used ALMA in extended configuration (resolution \textasciitilde 0.064") to measure the 1287 um (233 GHz) continuum flux of the comet. Observations were performed on August 8, 2021 at a 20.0 au distance from the Sun. The high spatial resolution was chosen in order to filter out any dust contribution. We detected the thermal emission of the object at \textasciitilde 10 sigma, with a flux of 0.128+/-0.012 mJy. Based on observational constraints and our theoretical estimates of the dust contribution, the entirety of the measured flux can be attributed to the nucleus. From NEATM modelling combined with the Hr magnitude, we determine a surface-equivalent diameter of 137+/-17 km and a red geometric albedo of 5.3+/-1.2 \%. This confirms that 2014 UN271 is by far the largest Oort-cloud object ever found (almost twice as large as comet C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp), and except for the Centaur 95P/Chiron which shows outburst-like activity, the largest known comet in the Solar System. On the other hand, the object albedo is typical of comets, adding credence for a "universal" comet nucleus albedo. With its distant perihelion and uniquely large size, 2014 UN271 is the prominent archetype of distant comets, whose activity is driven by hypervolatiles. Post-perihelion thermal measurements will permit to study possible albedo changes, such as a surface brightening compared to pre-perihelion, as was observed for Hale-Bopp.},

We applied this method to 105 images taken in 2015 July, 2015 December and 2016 January, identifying more than 20000 individual objects. We performed a photometric analysis of them, finding their phase function. This phase function follows the same trend as the one found for the nucleus, consistent with the detected particles having a size larger than \$\textbackslash sim 1\$ mm. Additionally, the phase function becomes shallower for increasing heliocentric distances, indicating a decrease in the mean agglomerate size. In order to characterize the agglomerates observed in the image, we developed a simplified model for their ejection and dynamics in the coma, and generated synthetic images based on it. We solved the inverse problem by finding the simulation parameters that give the best fit between synthetic and real images. In doing so, we were able to obtain a mean agglomerate size \$\textbackslash sim\$ dm and initial speed \$\textbackslash simeq\$ 1 m s\$\^\{-1\}\$. Both show a decrease with increasing heliocentric distance, sign of the reduction in activity.

The key assumptions that were required were translational and rotational equivariance, and Newton's second and third laws of motion. Our approach correctly discovered the form of the symbolic force law. Furthermore, our approach did not require any assumptions about the masses of planets and moons or physical constants. They, too, were accurately inferred through our methods. Though, of course, the classical law of gravitation has been known since Isaac Newton, our result serves as a validation that our method can discover unknown laws and hidden properties from observed data.

For these experiments, a dust analogue was created with physical properties comparable to those of the non-volatile dust found on comets. This "CoPhyLab dust" is planned to be mixed with water and CO2 ice and placed under cometary conditions in vacuum chambers to study the physical processes taking place on the nuclei of comets. In order to develop this dust analogue, we mixed two components representative for the non-volatile materials present in cometary nuclei. We chose silica dust as representative for the mineral phase and charcoal for the organic phase, which also acts as a darkening agent. In this paper, we provide an overview of known cometary analogues before presenting measurements of eight physical properties of different mixtures of the two materials and a comparison of these measurements with known cometary values. The physical properties of interest are: particle size, density, gas permeability, spectrophotometry, mechanical, thermal and electrical properties. We found that the analogue dust that matches the highest number of physical properties of cometary materials consists of a mixture of either 60\%/40\% or 70\%/30\% of silica dust/charcoal by mass. These best-fit dust analogue will be used in future CoPhyLab experiments.},

Therefore, previously undiscovered aspherical minor planets may experience a shape-driven selection effect in systematic surveys versus their spherical counterparts. In this study, we conduct injection-recovery exercises of synthetic asteroid lightcurves using a simple model to quantify the effect of varying axial ratio on detection efficiencies. We find that high-amplitude lightcurves are confronted with adverse selection effects for survey cadences and discovery thresholds for constructing tracklets that are representative of modern and proposed future nearEarth object searches. Furthermore, we illustrate the possible hazards of drawing population-level inferences on an underlying reservoir of elongated small bodies. If physical size and characteristic axial ratios are correlated, then size-frequency distributions may require revision at small diameters. In particular, this effect could alter the estimated populations of near-Earth objects. We conclude by discussing the applicability of our results to various other classes of solar system minor planets and interstellar interlopers, as well as discussing future work that may further interrogate this detection bias.},

  abstract = {We explore the origin and orbital evolution of the Kuiper belt in the framework of a recent model of the dynamical evolution of the giant planets, sometimes known as the Nice model. This model is characterized by a short, but violent, instability phase, during which the planets were on large eccentricity orbits. It successfully explains, for the first time, the current orbital architecture of the giant planets [Tsiganis, K., Gomes, R., Morbidelli, A., Levison, H.F., 2005. Nature 435, 459\textendash 461], the existence of the Trojans populations of Jupiter and Neptune [Morbidelli, A., Levison, H.F., Tsiganis, K., Gomes, R., 2005. Nature 435, 462\textendash 465], and the origin of the late heavy bombardment of the terrestrial planets [Gomes, R., Levison, H.F., Tsiganis, K., Morbidelli, A., 2005. Nature 435, 466\textendash 469]. One characteristic of this model is that the proto-planetary disk must have been truncated at roughly 30 to 35 AU so that Neptune would stop migrating at its currently observed location. As a result, the Kuiper belt would have initially been empty. In this paper we present a new dynamical mechanism which can deliver objects from the region interior to {$\sim$}35 AU to the Kuiper belt without excessive inclination excitation. In particular, we show that during the phase when Neptune's eccentricity is large, the region interior to its 1:2 mean motion resonance becomes unstable and disk particles can diffuse into this area. In addition, we perform numerical simulations where the planets are forced to evolve using fictitious analytic forces, in a way consistent with the direct N-body simulations of the Nice model. Assuming that the last encounter with Uranus delivered Neptune onto a low-inclination orbit with a semi-major axis of {$\sim$}27 AU and an eccentricity of {$\sim$}0.3, and that subsequently Neptune's eccentricity damped in {$\sim$}1 My, our simulations reproduce the main observed properties of the Kuiper belt at an unprecedented level. In particular, our results explain, at least qualitatively: (1) the co-existence of resonant and non-resonant populations, (2) the eccentricity\textendash inclination distribution of the Plutinos, (3) the peculiar semi-major axis\textemdash eccentricity distribution in the classical belt, (4) the outer edge at the 1:2 mean motion resonance with Neptune, (5) the bi-modal inclination distribution of the classical population, (6) the correlations between inclination and physical properties in the classical Kuiper belt, and (7) the existence of the so-called extended scattered disk. Nevertheless, we observe in the simulations a deficit of nearly-circular objects in the classical Kuiper belt.},

They are moving around the L4 and L5 triangular Lagrangian points of the Sun-Jupiter system and their distributions can provide important clues to the early evolution of the Solar System. Aims. The number asymmetry of the L4 and L5 Jupiter Trojans is a longstanding problem. We aim to test a new mechanism in order to explain this anomalous feature by invoking the jumping-Jupiter scenario. Methods. First, we introduce the orbital evolution of Jupiter caused by the giant planet instability in the early Solar System. In this scenario, Jupiter could undergo an outward migration at a very high speed. We then investigate how such a jump changes the numbers of the L4 (N4) and L5 (N5) Trojans. Results. The outward migration of Jupiter can distort the co-orbital orbits near the Lagrangian points, resulting in L4 Trojans being more stable than the L5 ones. We find that, this mechanism could potentially explain the unbiased number asymmetry of N4/N5\textasciitilde 1.6 for the known Jupiter Trojans. The uncertainties of the system parameters, e.g. Jupiter's eccentricity and inclination, the inclination distribution of Jupiter Trojans, are also taken into account and our results about the L4/L5 asymmetry have been further validated. However, the resonant amplitudes of the simulated Trojans are excited to higher values compared to the current population. A possible solution is that collisions among the Trojans may reduce their resonant amplitudes.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             In the framework of the visible NEAs observations survey (ViNOS) that uses several telescopes at the Canary Islands observatories since 2018, we observed two superfast rotator NEAs, 2021 NY1 and 2022 AB. We obtained photometry and spectrophotometry of both targets and visible spectroscopy of 2022 AB. Light curves of 2021 NY1 obtained in four different nights between 2021 September 30 and 2021 October 16 return a rotation period P~= 13.3449~{$\pm~$}0.0013 minutes and a light curve amplitude A~= 1.00 mag. We found that 2021 NY1 is a very elongated superfast rotator with an axis ratio a/b {$\geq$} 3.6. We also report colours (g - r)~= 0.664~{$\pm~$}0.013, (r - i)~= 0.186~{$\pm~$}0.013, and (i - zs)~= -0.117~{$\pm~$}0.012 mag. These are compatible with an S-type asteroid. The light curves of 2022 AB obtained on 2021 January 5 and 2021 January 8 show a rotation period P~= 3.0304~{$\pm~$}0.0008 min, with amplitudes A~= 0.52 and A~= 0.54 mag. 2022 AB is also an elongated object with axis ratio a/b {$\geq$} 1.6. The obtained colours are (g - r)~= 0.400~{$\pm~$}0.017, (r - i)~= 0.133~{$\pm~$}0.017, and (i - zs)~= 0.093~{$\pm~$}0.016. These colours are similar to those of the X-types, but with an unusually high (g - r) value. Spectra obtained on 2022 January 12 and 2022 January 14 are consistent with the reported colours. The spectral upturn over the 0.4 - 0.6 \$\textbackslash mu \textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\$ region of 2022 AB does not fit with any known asteroid taxonomical class or meteorite spectrum, confirming its unusual surface properties.},

  abstract = {The secular dynamical evolution of a hierarchical three-body system in which a distant third object orbits around a binary has been studied extensively, demonstrating that the inner orbit can undergo large eccentricity and inclination oscillations. It was shown before that starting with a circular inner orbit, large mutual inclination (40{$\smwhtcircle$}\textendash 140{$\smwhtcircle$}) can produce long timescale modulations that drive the eccentricity to extremely large values and can flip the orbit. Here, we demonstrate that starting with an almost coplanar configuration, for eccentric inner and outer orbits, the eccentricity of the inner orbit can still be excited to high values, and the orbit can flip by {$\sim$}180{$\smwhtcircle$}, rolling over its major axis. The {$\sim$}180{$\smwhtcircle$} flip criterion and the flip timescale are described by simple analytic expressions that depend on the initial orbital parameters. With tidal dissipation, this mechanism can produce counter-orbiting exoplanetary systems. In addition, we also show that this mechanism has the potential to enhance the tidal disruption or collision rates for different systems. Furthermore, we explore the entire e1 and i0 parameter space that can produce flips.},

Because active asteroids are generally discovered by chance only after their tails have fully formed, the process of how impact ejecta evolve into a tail has, to our knowledge, not been directly observed. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission of NASA               2               , in addition to having successfully changed the orbital period of Dimorphos               3               , demonstrated the activation process of an asteroid resulting from an impact under precisely known conditions.

Our observations reveal the complex evolution of the ejecta, which are first dominated by the gravitational interaction between the Didymos binary system and the ejected dust and subsequently by solar radiation pressure.

The dust production rate of C/Siding Spring, quantified by Af{$\rho$}, is 590{$\pm$}30, 640{$\pm$}30, and 670{$\pm$}30 cm in a 420 km radius aperture at a38\textdegree{} solar phase angle through the three filters, respectively, consistent with other observations at asimilar time and geometry, and with model predictions based on earlier measurements. The dust expansion velocity is {$\sim$}150\textendash 250 m s-1 for micron-sized dust grains, similar to the speeds found for other comets. The coma has a color slope of (5.5{$\pm$}1.5)\%/100 nm between 689 and 845 nm, similar to previous HST measurements at comparable aperture sizes, consistent with the lack of color dependence on heliocentric distance for almost all previously observed active comets. The rotational period of the nucleus of C/Siding Spring is determined from the periodic brightness variation in the coma to be 8.00{$\pm$}0.08 hr, with no excited rotational state detected. The dust coma shows a broad and diffuse fan-shaped feature in the sunward direction, with no temporal morphological variation observed. The projected orientation of the dust feature, combined with the previous analysis of the coma morphology and other characteristics, suggests secular activity evolution of the comet in its inner solar system passage as one previously observed active region turns off whereas new regions exposed to sunlight due to seasonal illumination change.},

  abstract = {The minor planets on orbits that are dynamically stable in Neptune's 1:1 resonance on Gyr timescales were likely em:laced by Neptune's outward migration. We explore the intrinsic libration amplitude, eccentricity, and inclination distribution of Neptune's stable Trojans, using the detections and survey efficiency of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) and Pan-STARRS1. We find that the libration amplitude of the stable Neptunian Trojan population can be well modeled as a Rayleigh distribution with a libration amplitude width {$\mathsl{\sigma}\mathsl{A}\mathsl{\phi}$} of 15{$\smwhtcircle$}. When taken as a whole, the Neptune Trojan population can be acceptably modeled with a Rayleigh eccentricity distribution of width {$\mathsl{\sigma}\mathsl{e}$} of 0.045 and a typical sin(i) \texttimes{} Gaussian inclination distribution with a width {$\mathsl{\sigma}\mathsl{i}$} of 14 {$\pm$} 2{$\smwhtcircle$}; however, these distributions are only marginally acceptable. This is likely because, even after accounting for survey detection biases, the known large (H{$\mathsl{r}$} {$<$} 8) and small (H{$\mathsl{r}$} {$\geq$} 8) Neptune Trojans appear to have markedly different eccentricities and inclinations. We propose that like the classical Kuiper belt, the stable intrinsic Neptunian Trojan population have dynamically `hot' and dynamically `cold' components to its eccentricity/inclination distribution, with {$\mathsl{\sigma}\mathsl{e}-\mathsl{c}\mathsl{o}\mathsl{l}\mathsl{d}$} {$\sim$} 0.02/{$\mathsl{\sigma}\mathsl{i}-\mathsl{c}\mathsl{o}\mathsl{l}\mathsl{d}$} {$\sim$} 6{$\smwhtcircle$} and {$\mathsl{\sigma}\mathsl{e}-\Planckconst\mathsl{o}\mathsl{t}$} {$\sim$} 0.05/{$\mathsl{\sigma}\mathsl{i}-\Planckconst\mathsl{o}\mathsl{t}$} {$\sim$} 18{$\smwhtcircle$}. In this scenario, the `cold' L4 Neptunian Trojan population lacks the {$\mathsl{H}\mathsl{r}$} {$\geq$} 8.0 members and has 13+-161 `cold' Trojans with {$\mathsl{H}\mathsl{r}$} {$<$} 8.0. On the other hand, the `hot' L4 Neptunian Trojan population has 136+-8745 Trojans with {$\mathsl{H}\mathsl{r}$} {$<$} 10 \textemdash{} a population 2.4 times greater than that of the L4 Jovian Trojans in the same luminosity range.},

We compare these results with the orbital parameters of the selected comets to identify trends related to their dynamical history. With these analyses, we tentatively identify at least three chemical classes based mainly on relative abundances of CO, CH3OH, CH4, C2H6, HCN, and NH3. The combination of relative abundances and orbital parameters is then compared with recent chemical models of planetary system formation. This approach may help in investigating the origins and evolution of the material in cometary nuclei. Among other aspects, we underline the need to increase our sample size, especially for hypervolatiles (i.e., CH4 and CO) in Jupiter family comets.},

The re-evaluation of these data shows the improvement of results in some of the data sets, in particular for comets observed and analyzed before the advent of new and revised fluorescence models and terrestrial retrieval methods introduced since 2011. We observe significant improvements in the resulting rotational temperatures and the production rates for all species, and in mixing ratios of minor species (relative to water). The re-analysis also allowed us to quantify species not analyzed previously, mostly due to the lack of molecular models (e.g., ammonia and formaldehyde). We note, however, that the improvement of these revised values is less substantial for comets observed (and/or analyzed) since 2010.},

SW1 is unique among the Centaurs in that it experiences quasi-regular major outbursts and produces CO emission continuously; however, the source of the CO is unclear. We argue that due to its very large size (approx. 32 km radius), SW1 is likely still responding, via amorphous water ice (AWI) conversion to crystalline water ice (CWI), to the rapid change in its external thermal environment produced by its dynamical migration from the Kuiper belt to the Gateway Region at the inner edge of the Centaur region at 6 au. It is this conversion process that is the source of the abundant CO and dust released from the object during its quiescent and outburst phases. If correct, these arguments have a number of important predictions testable via remote sensing and in situ spacecraft characterization, including: the quick release on Myr timescales of CO from AWI conversion for any few km-scale scattered disk KBO transiting into the inner system; that to date SW1 has only converted between 50 to 65\% of its nuclear AWI to CWI; that volume changes upon AWI conversion could have caused subsidence and cave-ins, but not significant mass wasting or crater loss on SW1; that SW1s coma should contain abundant amounts of CWI CO2-rich icy dust particles; and that when SW1 transits into the inner system within the next 10,000 years, it will be a very different kind of JFC comet.},

  abstract = {In 2010 Jewitt and Li published a paper examining the behavior of comet-asteroid transition object 3200 Phaethon, arguing it was asteroid-like in its behavior throughout most of its orbit, but that near its perihelion, at a distance of only 0.165 AU from the sun, its dayside temperatures would be hot enough to vaporize rock ({$>$}1000 K, Hanus et al. 2016). Thus it would act like a "rock comet" as gases produced from evaporating rock were released from the body, in a manner similar to the more familiar sublimation of water ice into vacuum seen for comets coming within \textasciitilde 3 AU of the Sun. In this Note we predict that the same thermal effects that would create "rock comet" behavior with Qgas \textasciitilde{} 10\$\^\{22\}\$ mol/sec at perihelion would also help greatly bluen Phaethon's surface via preferential thermal alteration and sublimative removal of surface Fe and refractory organics, known reddening and darkening agents. These predictions are testable by searching for signs of spectral bluening of the surfaces of other objects in Phaethon-like small perihelion orbits, and by in situ measurements of Phaethons surface and coma composition near perihelion with the upcoming DESTINY+ mission to Phaethon by JAXA.},

  abstract = {The D/H ratio in cometary water has been shown to vary between 1 and 3 times the Earth's oceans value, in both Oort cloud comets and Jupiter-family comets originating from the Kuiper belt. This has been taken as evidence that comets contributed a relatively small fraction of the terrestrial water. We present new sensitive spectroscopic observations of water isotopologues in the Jupiterfamily comet 46P/Wirtanen carried out using the GREAT spectrometer aboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). The derived D/H ratio of (1.61 {$\pm$} 0.65) \texttimes{} 10-4 is the same as in the Earth's oceans. Although the statistics are limited, we show that interesting trends are already becoming apparent in the existing data. A clear anti-correlation is seen between the D/H ratio and the active fraction, defined as the ratio of the active surface area to the total nucleus surface. Comets with an active fraction above 0.5 typically have D/H ratios in water consistent with the terrestrial value. These hyperactive comets, such as 46P/Wirtanen, require an additional source of water vapor in their coma, explained by the presence of subliming icy grains expelled from the nucleus. The observed correlation may suggest that hyperactive comets belong to a population of ice-rich objects that formed just outside the snow line, or in the outermost regions of the solar nebula, from water thermally reprocessed in the inner disk that was transported outward during the early disk evolution. The observed anti-correlation between the active fraction and the nucleus size seems to argue against the first interpretation, as planetesimals near the snow line are expected to undergo rapid growth. Alternatively, isotopic properties of water outgassed from the nucleus and icy grains may be different due to fractionation effects at sublimation. In this case, all comets may share the same Earth-like D/H ratio in water, with profound implications for the early solar system and the origin of Earth's oceans.},

  abstract = {Significance             Planets perturb one another as they orbit their star. These perturbations can build up over a long time, leading to instability and chaos, and, ultimately, to dramatic events such as interplanetary collisions. We focus here on ``secular chaos,'' which is the chaos that arises in the orbit-averaged equations. We explain how secular chaos works and show that it explains the chaos of Mercury's orbit. We also show that secular chaos could be responsible for the formation of ``hot Jupiters,'' which are Jupiter-mass planets that orbit very close to their star. Finally, we suggest that secular chaos might be important not only for Mercury and hot Jupiters, but also more generally for organizing a wide variety of extrasolar planetary systems.           ,              In the inner solar system, the planets' orbits evolve chaotically, driven primarily by secular chaos. Mercury has a particularly chaotic orbit and is in danger of being lost within a few billion years. Just as secular chaos is reorganizing the solar system today, so it has likely helped organize it in the past. We suggest that extrasolar planetary systems are also organized to a large extent by secular chaos. A hot Jupiter could be the end state of a secularly chaotic planetary system reminiscent of the solar system. However, in the case of the hot Jupiter, the innermost planet was Jupiter (rather than Mercury) sized, and its chaotic evolution was terminated when it was tidally captured by its star. In this contribution, we review our recent work elucidating the physics of secular chaos and applying it to Mercury and to hot Jupiters. We also present results comparing the inclinations of hot Jupiters thus produced with observations.},

The prevailing view is that a rapidly formed Jupiter acted as a barrier between these reservoirs. We show a fundamental inconsistency in this model: if Jupiter is an efficient blocker of drifting pebbles, then the interior NC reservoir is depleted by radial drift within a few hundred thousand years. If Jupiter lets material pass it, then the two reservoirs will be mixed. Instead, we demonstrate that the arrival of the CC pebbles in the inner disk is delayed for several million years by the viscous expansion of the protoplanetary disk. Our results support that Jupiter formed in the outer disk ({$>$}10 AU) and allowed a considerable amount of CC material to pass it and become accreted by the terrestrial planets.},

We find that addition of graphite, magnetite and troilite all darken the reflectance spectrum of our forsterite samples and cause the spectral slope to decrease (become blue). These spectral changes can be caused by both nm- and micron-sized grains. In the ultraviolet-visible region, we find that graphite is most efficient at altering the spectral slope, while in the near-infrared, magnetite is the most efficient. At all wavelengths studied, graphite is the most efficient at darkening our sample spectrum. However, the observation that troilite also alters the slope and albedo of our samples suggests that the spectral changes caused by magnetite and graphite may not be unique. In addition, we find that the spectral slopes in our mixtures compare generally well to what has been observed on Bennu suggesting that a significant portion of fine-grained dark material, including sulfides, present in the regolith can cause the observed negative (blue) slope found on B-type asteroids.},

We obtain the boundary in parameter space [size, rock-content] between bodies that differentiate, forming a rocky core, and those which remain undifferentiated: small bodies, bodies with a low rock content, and the largest bodies considered, which develop high internal pressures and barely attain the melting temperature. The final differentiated structure comprises a rocky core, an ice-rich mantle, and a thin dense crust below the surface. We obtain and discuss the bulk density-radius relationship.

Further analysis shows that for the three `stellar-like' comets the possible coma contribution to the observed flux does not exceed 12.2 per cent, and in the case of comet 143P/Kowal\textendash Mrkos the coma contribution is expected to be as low as 1 per cent, and so the resulting photometry most likely represents that of the projected nucleus surface. Effective radii for the inactive comets range from 1.02 to 4.56 km, and the effective radius upper limits for the active comets range from 1.94 to 4.15 km.

Significant connections across multiple science domains will be a hallmark of LSST; the DC2 program represents a unique modeling effort that stresses this interconnectivity in a way that has not been attempted before. This effort encompasses a full end-to-end approach: starting from a large N-body simulation, through setting up LSST-like observations including realistic cadences, through image simulations, and finally processing with Rubin's LSST Science Pipelines. This last step ensures that we generate data products resembling those to be delivered by the Rubin Observatory as closely as is currently possible. The simulated DC2 sky survey covers six optical bands in a wide-fast-deep (WFD) area of approximately 300 deg2 as well as a deep drilling field (DDF) of approximately 1 deg2. We simulate 5 years of the planned 10-year survey. The DC2 sky survey has multiple purposes. First, the LSST DESC working groups can use the dataset to develop a range of DESC analysis pipelines to prepare for the advent of actual data. Second, it serves as a realistic testbed for the image processing software under development for LSST by the Rubin Observatory. In particular, simulated data provide a controlled way to investigate certain image-level systematic effects. Finally, the DC2 sky survey enables the exploration of new scientific ideas in both static and time-domain cosmology.},

  abstract = {A survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields to faint magnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the exciting science opportunities of the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6 deg\^2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 deg\^2 south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r\textasciitilde 27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z\textasciitilde 1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

  abstract = {The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is designed to provide an unprecedented optical imaging dataset that will support investigations of our Solar System, Galaxy and Universe, across half the sky and over ten years of repeated observation. However, exactly how the LSST observations will be taken (the observing strategy or "cadence") is not yet finalized. In this dynamically-evolving community white paper, we explore how the detailed performance of the anticipated science investigations is expected to depend on small changes to the LSST observing strategy. Using realistic simulations of the LSST schedule and observation properties, we design and compute diagnostic metrics and Figures of Merit that provide quantitative evaluations of different observing strategies, analyzing their impact on a wide range of proposed science projects. This is work in progress: we are using this white paper to communicate to each other the relative merits of the observing strategy choices that could be made, in an effort to maximize the scientific value of the survey. The investigation of some science cases leads to suggestions for new strategies that could be simulated and potentially adopted. Notably, we find motivation for exploring departures from a spatially uniform annual tiling of the sky: focusing instead on different parts of the survey area in different years in a "rolling cadence" is likely to have significant benefits for a number of time domain and moving object astronomy projects. The communal assembly of a suite of quantified and homogeneously coded metrics is the vital first step towards an automated, systematic, science-based assessment of any given cadence simulation, that will enable the scheduling of the LSST to be as well-informed as possible.},

  abstract = {Near-Earth asteroid (3200) Phaethon is an active asteroid with a dust tail repeatedly observed over the past decade for 3 days during each perihelion passage down to a heliocentric distance of 0.14 au. The mechanism causing the activity is still debated, and the suggested mechanisms lack clear supporting evidence. Phaethon has been identified as the likely parent body of the annual Geminid meteor shower, making it one of the few active asteroids associated with a meteoroid stream. Its low albedo and B-type reflectance spectrum indicates that Phaethon's composition is similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, but a connection to a specific meteorite group is ambiguous due to the lack of diagnostic absorption features. In this study, we analyze the mid-infrared emissivity spectrum of Phaethon and find that it is closely associated with the Yamato-group (CY) of carbonaceous chondrites. The CY chondrites represent primitive carbonaceous material that experienced early aqueous alteration and subsequent late-stage thermal metamorphism. Minerals in these meteorites, some of which we identify in Phaethon's spectrum, show evidence of thermal decomposition; notably, the dehydroxylation and transformation of phyllosilicates into poorly crystalline olivine. Additionally, sulfides and carbonates in CYs are known release S2and CO2 gas upon heating to \textasciitilde 700oC. We show that Phaethon's surface temperature during its observed window of activity is consistent with the thermal decomposition temperatures of several components in CY meteorites. All of these lines of evidence are strong indicators that gas release from thermal decomposition reactions is responsible for Phaethon's activity. The results of this study have implications for the formation of the Geminid meteoroid stream, the origins of thermally-altered primitive meteorites, and the destruction of low-perihelion asteroids.},

  abstract = {Asteroid surfaces are subjected to mechanical weathering processes that result in the development and evolution of regolith. Two proposed mechanisms--impact bombardment and thermal fatigue--have been proposed as viable and dominant weathering processes. Previously, we compiled and estimated thermal inertias of several hundred asteroids (mostly in the main-belt) for which we determined dependencies on temperature, diameter, and rotation period. In this work, we estimate grain sizes of asteroid regoliths from this large thermal inertia dataset using thermal conductivity models. Following our previous work we perform multi-variate linear model fits to the grain size dataset and quantify its dependency on diameter and rotation period. We find that the best-fit model fit indicates that asteroid grain sizes are inversely dependent on object size for {$<$}10 km asteroids and exhibits no relationship above this size cutoff. Rotation period and grain size show a positive relationship when the rotation period is greater than \textasciitilde 5 hr, and an inverse relationship below this rotation period. We conclude that both impact weathering and thermal fatigue are significant regolith evolution mechanisms. Furthermore, we run post-hoc t-tests between spectral groups to identify compositional differences among our asteroid set. Notably, suspected metal-rich, M-type and E-type asteroids have larger than expected grain sizes, and P-types have distinctly smaller grains than other groups},

We found that the shapes of size distributions of asteroids with the C-like and S-like colors agree with each other in the size range of 0.4 - 5 km in diameter. Assuming the asteroid population in this size range is under collision equilibrium, our results indicate that compositional difference hardly affects the size dependence of impact strength, at least for the size range between several hundred meters and several kilometers. This size range corresponds to the size range of ``spin-barrier'', an upper limit observed in the rotation rate distribution. Our results are consistent with the view that most asteroids in this size range have a rubble-pile structure.},

Here, we perform N-body simulations to study the effects of pebble accretion onto growing planetesimals of different diameters located in the inner Solar System. The simulations are run to occur during the lifetime of the gas disc while also simultaneously taking Jupiter's growth into account. We find that pebble accretion can increase the mass in the solid disc by at least a few times its initial mass with reasonable assumptions that pebbles fragment to smaller-sized grains at the snow line and that gas-disc-induced orbital migration effects are in force. Such a large contribution in mass by pebbles would seem to imply that the isotopic composition of the inner Solar System should be similar to the pebble source (i.e. outer Solar System). This implication appears to violate the observed nucleosynthetic isotopic dichotomy of the sampled Solar System. Thus, pebble accretion played little or no role in terrestrial planet formation.},

  abstract = {Asteroid phase curves are used to derive fundamental physical properties through the determination of the absolute magnitude H. The upcoming visible Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and mid-infrared Near-Earth Object Surveillance Mission (NEOSM) surveys rely on these absolute magnitudes to derive the colours and albedos of millions of asteroids. Furthermore, the shape of the phase curves reflects their surface compositions, allowing for conclusions on their taxonomy. We derive asteroid phase curves from dual-band photometry acquired by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescopes. Using Bayesian parameter inference, we retrieve the ab\- solute magnitudes and slope parameters of 127,012 phase curves of 94,777 asteroids in the photometric H, G1, G2- and H, G12*-systems. The taxonomic complexes of asteroids separate in the observed G1, G2-distributions, correlating with their mean visual albedo. This allows for differentiating the X-complex into the P-, M-, and Ecomplexes using the slope parameters as alternative to albedo measurements. Further, taxonomic mis\- classifications from spectrophotometric datasets as well as interlopers in dynamical families of asteroids reveal themselves in G1, G2-space. The H, G12*-model applied to the serendipitous observations is unable to resolve target taxonomy. The G1, G2 phase coefficients show wavelength-dependency for the majority of taxonomic complexes. Their values allow for estimating the degree of phase reddening of the spectral slope. The uncertainty of the phase coefficients and the derived absolute magnitude is dominated by the observational coverage of the opposition effect rather than the magnitude dispersion induced by the asteroids' irregular shapes and orienta\- tions. Serendipitous asteroid observations allow for reliable phase curve determination for a large number of asteroids. To ensure that the acquired absolute magnitudes are suited for colour computations, it is imperative that future surveys densely cover the opposition effects of the phase curves, minimizing the uncertainty on H. The phase curve slope parameters offer an accessible dimension for taxonomic classification, correlating with the albedo and complimentary to the spectral dimension.},

We identify 17 classes split into the three complexes C, M, and S, including the new Z-class for extremely-red objects in the main belt. The visual albedo information resolves the spectral degeneracy of the X-complex and establishes the P-class as part of the C-complex. We present a classification tool which computes probabilistic class assignments within this taxonomic scheme from asteroid observations, intrinsically accounting for degeneracies between classes based on the observed wavelength region. The taxonomic classifications of 6038 observations of 4526 individual asteroids are published. Conclusions. The ability to classify partial observations and the reintroduction of the visual albedo into the classification provide a taxonomy which is well suited for the current and future datasets of asteroid observations, in particular provided by the Gaia, MITHNEOS, NEO Surveyor, and SPHEREx surveys.},

  abstract = {Celestial bodies approximated with rigid triaxial ellipsoids in a two-body system can rotate chaotically due to the time-varying gravitational torque from the central mass. At small orbital eccentricity values, rotation is short-term orderly and predictable within the commensurate spin-orbit resonances, while at eccentricity approaching unity, chaos completely takes over. Here, we present the full 3D rotational equations of motion around all three principle axes for triaxial minor planets and two independent methods of numerical solution based on Euler rotations and quaternion algebra. The domains of chaotic rotation are numerically investigated over the entire range of eccentricity with a combination of trial integrations of Euler's equations of motion and the GALI(\$k\$) method. We quantify the dependence of the order--chaos boundaries on shape by changing a prolateness parameter, and find that the main 1:1 spin-orbit resonance disappears for specific moderately prolate shapes already at eccentricities as low as 0.3. The island of short-term stability around the main 1:1 resonance shrinks with increasing eccentricity at a fixed low degree of prolateness and completely vanishes at approximately 0.8. This island is also encroached by chaos on longer time scales indicating longer Lyapunov exponents. Trajectories in the close vicinity of the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance become chaotic at smaller eccentricities, but separated enclaves of orderly rotation emerge at eccentricities as high as 0.8. Initial perturbations of rotational velocity in latitude away from the exact equilibrium result in a spectrum of free libration, nutation, and polar wander, which is not well matched by the linearized analysis omitting the inertial terms.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             We show that if comets (or any small icy planetesimals such as Kuiper belt objects) are composed of pebble piles, their internal radiogenic as well as geochemical heating results in considerably different evolutionary outcomes compared to similar past studies. We utilize a 1D thermophysical evolution code, modified to include state-of-the-art empirical measurements of pebble thermal conductivity and compression, the latter obtained through a new laboratory experiment presented here for the first time. Results indicate that due to the low pebble thermal conductivity, the peak temperatures attained during evolution are much higher than in any previous study given the same formation time. Assuming meteoritic radiogenic abundances, we find that only extremely small, sub-kilometre comets have the potential to retain the primordial, uniform, and thermally unprocessed composition from which they formed. Comets with radii in excess of about 20~km are typically swept by rapid and energetically powerful aqueous hydration reactions. Across the full range of comet sizes and formation times, evolutions result in the processing and differentiation of various volatile species, and a radially heterogeneous nucleus structure. Our computations however also indicate that the assumed fraction of radionuclides is a pivotal free parameter, because isotopic analyses of the only available cometary samples suggest that no 26Al was ever present in comet 81P/Wild 2. We show that if comets formed early in the protoplanetary disc (within 1\textendash 3~Myr), the radionuclide abundances indeed must be much smaller than those typically assumed based on meteoritic samples. We discuss the importance of our findings for the formation, present-day attributes and future research of comets.},

  abstract = {Perturbative analyses of planetary resonances commonly predict singularities and/or divergences of resonance widths at very low and very high eccentricities. We have recently re-examined the nature of these divergences using non-perturbative numerical analyses, making use of Poincar\textasciiacute e sections but from a different perspective relative to previous implementations of this method. This perspective reveals fine structure of resonances which otherwise remains hidden in conventional approaches, including analytical, semi-analytical and numerical-averaging approaches based on the critical resonant angle. At low eccentricity, first order resonances do not have diverging widths but have two asymmetric branches leading away from the nominal resonance location. A sequence of structures called ``low-eccentricity resonant bridges'' connecting neighboring resonances is revealed. At planet-grazing eccentricity, the true resonance width is non-divergent. At higher eccentricities, the new results reveal hitherto unknown resonant structures and show that these parameter regions have a loss of some \textendash{} though not necessarily entire \textendash{} resonance libration zones to chaos. The chaos at high eccentricities was previously attributed to the overlap of neighboring resonances. The new results reveal the additional role of bifurcations and co-existence of phase-shifted resonance zones at higher eccentricities. By employing a geometric point of view, we relate the high eccentricity phase space structures and their transitions to the shapes of resonant orbits in the rotating frame. We outline some directions for future research to advance understanding of the dynamics of mean motion resonances.},

The orbits of Pluto and Neptune overlap, but close approaches of these two planets are prevented by the existence of a resonance condition1: Pluto's orbital period is exactly 3/2 that of Neptune, which ensures that the conjunctions always occur near Pluto's aphelion. Long-term orbit integrations2-5 have uncovered other subtle resonances and near-resonances, and indicate that Pluto's orbit is chaotic yet remains macroscopically stable over billion-year timescales. A suggestion4 that the orbit may have evolved purely by chaotic dynamics appears unlikely in light of recent orbital stability studies6, unless one appeals to a well-timed collision to place Pluto in its stable orbit19. Here I show that Pluto could have acquired its current orbit during the late stages of planetary accretion, when the jovian planets underwent significant orbital migration as a result of encounters with residual planetesimals7. As Neptune moved outwards, a small body like Pluto in an initially circular orbit could have been captured into the 3:2 resonance, following which its orbital eccentricity would rise rapidly to its current Neptune-crossing value.},

However, some properties remain an enigma. Pluto's long term orbital stability is supported by two special properties of its orbit that limit the location of its perihelion in azimuth and in latitude. We revisit Pluto's orbital dynamics with a view to elucidating the individual and collective gravitational effects of the giant planets on constraining its perihelion location. While the resonant perturbations from Neptune account for the azimuthal constraint on Pluto's perihelion location, we demonstrate that the long term and steady persistence of the latitudinal constraint is possible only in a narrow range of additional secular forcing which arises fortuitously from the particular orbital architecture of the other giant planets. Our investigations also find that Jupiter has a largely stabilizing influence whereas Uranus has a largely destabilizing influence on Pluto's orbit. Overall, Pluto's orbit is rather surprisingly close to a zone of strong chaos.},

  abstract = {The NASA Dawn spacecraft took off from Cape Canaveral in September 2007 atop a Delta II rocket starting an ambitious journey to Vesta and Ceres, the two most massive worlds in the largest reservoir of asteroids in the Solar System, the Main Belt. Prior to the Dawn launch, Earth-bound observations of Vesta and Ceres revealed intriguing features--from Vesta's rugged shape to Ceres' tenuous water exosphere--, but these objects remained fuzzy speckles of light even through the lenses of the most powerful telescopes. With Dawn's exploration of Vesta (2011-2012) and Ceres (2015-2018) these two worlds came into focus. Breath-taking details emerged of how large collisions sculpted Vesta liberating massive amounts of material in the inner Main Belt, providing the source of an important family of meteorites recovered on Earth. Ceres' complex geology, which may rival that of the Earth and Mars, unveiled recent cryovolcanic activity. This book is dedicated to these highlights, and many more discoveries of the Dawn mission. By the time Dawn completed its mission in 2018, our understanding of the formation of the Solar System had greatly evolved thanks to new theoretical models and to a new trove of meteorite geochemical data, and Dawn observations of Vesta and Ceres provide new, vital constraints to synergistically interpret models and data. The broader implications of the Dawn legacy are presented in a series of dedicated chapters. The editors hope this book will serve as a solid reference for the younger generations as well as for more seasoned researchers to successfully pursue future exploration of the Main Belt. We certainly have learned a lot thanks to Dawn, and yet we know that we have barely scratched the surface of what Main Belt asteroids can tell us about the dawn of our Solar System.},

  abstract = {Context. Recent results for asteroid rotation periods from the TESS mission showed how strongly previous studies have underestimated the number of slow rotators, revealing the importance of studying those targets. For most slowly rotating asteroids (those with P {$>$} 12 h), no spin and shape model is available because of observation selection effects. This hampers determination of their thermal parameters and accurate sizes. Also, it is still unclear whether signatures of different surface material properties can be seen in thermal inertia determined from mid-infrared thermal flux fitting. Aims: We continue our campaign in minimising selection effects among main belt asteroids. Our targets are slow rotators with low light-curve amplitudes. Our goal is to provide their scaled spin and shape models together with thermal inertia, albedo, and surface roughness to complete the statistics. Methods: Rich multi-apparition datasets of dense light curves are supplemented with data from Kepler and TESS spacecrafts. In addition to data in the visible range, we also use thermal data from infrared space observatories (mainly IRAS, Akari and WISE) in a combined optimisation process using the Convex Inversion Thermophysical Model. This novel method has so far been applied to only a few targets, and therefore in this work we further validate the method itself. Results: We present the models of 16 slow rotators, including two updated models. All provide good fits to both thermal and visible data.The obtained sizes are on average accurate at the 5\% precision level, with diameters found to be in the range from 25 to 145 km. The rotation periods of our targets range from 11 to 59 h, and the thermal inertia covers a wide range of values, from 2 to {$<$}400 J m-2 s-1/2 K-1, not showing any correlation with the period. Conclusions: With this work we increase the sample of slow rotators with reliable spin and shape models and known thermal inertia by 40\%. The thermal inertia values of our sample do not display a previously suggested increasing trend with rotation period, which mightbe due to their small skin depth.

However, deep and fast encounters also take place, albeit with lower probability, particularly if one of the objects involved is a stellar remnant ejected during a supernova. WD 0810-353 might be a high velocity white dwarf, and it was recently identified as heading straight for the Solar System; however, the Gaia DR3 data that support its future deep and fast flyby are regarded as suspicious. Aims. Here, we reanalyze the Gaia DR3 data set associated with WD 0810-353 to confirm or reject the reality of its Solar System flyby and also to investigate its possible runaway status. Methods. We studied the evolution of WD 0810-353 forward in time using N-body simulations. We computed the distribution of distances of closest approach and their associated times of perihelion passage. We used a statistical analysis of the kinematics of this object to assess its possible hypervelocity. We compared its mean BP/RP spectrum to those of other well-studied white dwarfs. Results. We confirm that WD 0810-353 is headed for the Solar System, but the actual parameters of the encounter depend strongly on its radial velocity. The Gaia DR3 value of -373.74+/-8.18 km/s is strongly disfavored by our analyses. Its mean BP/RP spectrum suggests a value over ten times higher based on the position of its putative Halpha line. However, spectral matching using other white dwarfs with non-Gaia data indicate a radial velocity in the interval (-60, -70) km/s. Conclusions. These results confirm the future flyby of WD 0810-353 near the Solar System, although the relative velocity could be high enough or the minimum approach distance large enough to preclude any significant perturbation on the Oort cloud.},

We also investigated the likely source regions of such new arrivals. Asteroid 2020 UO43, if real, has a non-negligible probability of having an origin in the Oort cloud or even interstellar space. Asteroid 2003 BM1 may have come from the neighborhood of Uranus. However, most newcomers -- including 457175, 2011 QQ99, and 2021 UJ5 -- might have had an origin in Centaur orbital space.

The analysis of the distribution of the mutual nodal distances of the known extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs) that measure how close two orbits may get to each other could be such a game changer. Here, we use a sample of 51 ETNOs together with random shufflings of this sample and two unbiased scattered-disc orbital models to confirm a statistically significant (62 sigma) asymmetry between the shortest mutual ascending and descending nodal distances as well as the existence of multiple highly improbably (p {$<$} 0.0002) correlated pairs of orbits with mutual nodal distances as low as 0.2 au at 152 au from the Solar system's barycentre or 1.3 au at 339 au.

We find that the impact must have been quite slow ({$\lessequivlnt$} 5 m/s) and grazing (impact angles {$\greaterequivlnt$} 75{$\circ$}) in order to leave intact lobes after the merger, in the case that both progenitor objects were rubble piles. A gentle contact between two bodies in a close syn\- chronous orbit seems most plausible.},

  abstract = {In this work, we model the collisional evolution of the Jupiter Trojans and determined under which conditions the Eurybates-Queta system survives. We show that the collisional strength of the Jupiter Trojans and the age of the Eurybates family and by extension Queta are correlated. The collisional grinding of the Jupiter Trojan population over 4.5 Gy results in a size-frequency distribution (SFD) that remains largely unaltered at large sizes ({$>$}10 km) but is depleted at small sizes (10 m to 1 km). This results in a turnover in the SFD, the location of which depends on the collisional strength of the material. It is to be expected that the Trojan SFD bends between 1 and 10 km. Based on the SFD of the Eurybates family, we find that the family was likely the result of a catastrophic impact onto a 100 km rubble pile target. This corresponds to objects with a rather low collisional strength (10 times weaker than that of basaltic material studied in Benz \& Asphaug1999). Assuming this weak strength, and an initial cumulative slope of the size frequency distribution of 2.1 between diameters of 2 m and 100 km when the Trojans were captured, the existence of Queta, the satellite of Eurybates, implies an upper limit for the family age of 3.7 Gy. Alternatively, we demonstrate that an unconventional collisional strength with a minimum at 20 m is a plausible candidate to ensure the survival of Queta over the age of the Solar System. Finally, we show how different collisional histories change the expected number of craters on the targets of the Lucy mission and that Lucy will be able to differentiate between them.},

Carefully produced colour composite images are displayed to volunteers via a web-based classification interface, which records their estimates of the positions of candidate lensed features. Images of simulated lenses, as well as real images which lack lenses, are inserted into the image stream at random intervals; this training set is used to give the volunteers instantaneous feedback on their performance, as well as to calibrate a model of the system that provides dynamical updates to the probability that a classified image contains a lens. Low-probability systems are retired from the site periodically, concentrating the sample towards a set of lens candidates. Having divided 160 deg2 of Canada\textendash France\textendash Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey imaging into some 430 000 overlapping 82 by 82 arcsec tiles and displaying them on the site, we were joined by around 37 000 volunteers who contributed 11 million image classifications over the course of eight months. This stage 1 search reduced the sample to 3381 images containing candidates; these were then refined in stage 2 to yield a sample that we expect to be over 90 per cent complete and 30 per cent pure, based on our analysis of the volunteers performance on training images. We comment on the scalability of the SPACE WARPS system to the wide field survey era, based on our projection that searches of 105 images could be performed by a crowd of 105 volunteers in 6 d.},

In a companion paper by Fraser et al., we demonstrate that the observed color distribution of small (H{$>$}6) Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) can be accounted for by the existence of only two composition classes, named brightIR and faintIR, where the range of colors in each class is governed by a mixture of two material end members. Here, we investigate the orbital distribution of the two color classes identified by Fraser et al. and find that the orbital inclinations of the brightIR class objects are correlated with their optical colors. Using the output of numerical simulations investigating the orbital evolution of TNOs during their scattering phase with Neptune, we show that this correlation could reflect a composition gradient in the early protoplanetary disk, in the range of heliocentric distances over which TNOs from the brightIR class accreted. However, tensions between this interpretation and the existence of blue contaminants among cold classical TNOs, and possible alternative origins for the detected correlation, currently bear uncertainty on our proposed interpretation.},

These measurements were combined with previously published data (Binzel et al. 2019) and bias-corrected to derive the intrinsic compositional distribution of the overall NEO population, as well as of subpopulations coming from various escape routes (ERs) in the asteroid belt and beyond. The resulting distributions reflect well the overall compositional gradient of the asteroid belt, with decreasing fractions of silicate-rich (S- and Q-type) bodies and increasing fractions of carbonaceous (B-, C-, D- and P-type) bodies as a function of increasing ER distance from the Sun. The close compositional match between NEOs and their predicted source populations validates dynamical models used to identify ERs and argues against any strong composition change with size in the asteroid belt between \textasciitilde 5 km down to \textasciitilde 100 m. A notable exception comes from the over-abundance of D-type NEOs from the 5:2J and, to a lesser extend, the 3:1J and nu6 ERs, hinting at the presence of a large population of small D-type asteroids in the main belt. Alternatively, this excess may indicate preferential spectral evolution from D-type surfaces to C- and P-types as a consequence of space weathering, or to the fact that D-type objects fragment more often than other spectral types in the NEO space. No further evidence for the existence of collisional families in the main belt, below the detection limit of current main-belt surveys, was found in this work.},

  abstract = {Cybele asteroids constitute an appealing reservoir of primitive material genetically linked to the outer Solar System, and the physical properties of the largest members can be readily accessed by large telescopes. We took advantage of the bright apparition of (65) Cybele in July and August 2021 to acquire high-angular-resolution images and optical light curves of the asteroid with which we aim to analyse its shape and bulk properties. 7 series of images acquired with VLT/SPHERE were combined with optical light curves to reconstruct the shape of the asteroid using the ADAM, MPCD, and SAGE algorithms. The origin of the shape was investigated by means of N-body simulations. Cybele has a volume-equivalent diameter of 263+/-3km and a bulk density of 1.55+/-0.19g.cm-3. Notably, its shape and rotation state are closely compatible with those of a Maclaurin equilibrium figure. The lack of a collisional family associated with Cybele and the higher bulk density of that body with respect to other large P-type asteroids suggest that it never experienced any large disruptive impact followed by rapid re-accumulation. This would imply that its present-day shape represents the original one. However, numerical integration of the long-term dynamical evolution of a hypothetical family shows that it is dispersed by gravitational perturbations and chaotic diffusion over Gyrs of evolution. The very close match between Cybele and an equilibrium figure opens up the possibility that D{$>$}260km small bodies from the outer Solar System all formed at equilibrium. However, we cannot rule out an old impact as the origin of the equilibrium shape. Cybele itself is found to be dynamically unstable, implying that it was recently ({$<$}1Ga) placed on its current orbit either through slow diffusion from a relatively stable orbit in the Cybele region or, less likely, from an unstable, JFC orbit in the planet-crossing region.},

They may be as numerous as the main-belt asteroids and their dynamics is peculiar, involving a 1:1 resonance with Jupiter. Their origin probably dates back to the formation of Jupiter: the Trojan precursors were planetesimals orbiting close to the growing planet. Different mechanisms, including the mass growth of Jupiter, collisional diffusion, and gas drag friction, contributed to the capture of planetesimals in stable Trojan orbits before the final dispersal. The subsequent evolution of Trojan asteroids is the outcome of the joint action of different physical processes involving dynamical diffusion and excitation and collisional evolution. As a result, the present population is possibly different in both orbital and size distribution from the primordial one. No other significant population of Trojan asteroids have been found so far around other planets, apart from six Trojans of Mars, whose origin and evolution are probably very different from the Trojans of Jupiter.},

We find a dramatic change in polarimetric behavior from visible to near-infrared for these objects, including a change in the polarimetric inversion angle that is tied to the index of refraction of the surface material. Our observations support a two-phase surface composition consisting of high albedo and high index of refraction inclusions with a small optical size scale embedded in a dark matrix material more closely related to C-complex asteroids. These results are consistent with the interpretation that the Barbarians are remnants of a population of primitive bodies that formed shortly after calcium-aluminum-rich inclusion (CAIs). Near-infrared polarimetry provides a direct test of the constituent grains of asteroid surfaces.},

Using a NEATM thermal model fitting routine, we compute diameters for over 100,000 Main Belt asteroids from their IR thermal flux, with errors better than 10\%. We then incorporate literature values of visible measurements (in the form of the H absolute magnitude) to determine albedos. Using these data we investigate the albedo and diameter distributions of the Main Belt. As observed previously, we find a change in the average albedo when comparing the inner, middle, and outer portions of the Main Belt. We also confirm that the albedo distribution of each region is strongly bimodal. We observe groupings of objects with similar albedos in regions of the Main Belt associated with dynamical breakup families. Asteroid families typically show a characteristic albedo for all members, but there are notable exceptions to this. This paper is the first look at the Main Belt asteroids in the WISE data, and only represents the preliminary, observed raw size, and albedo distributions for the populations considered. These distributions are subject to survey biases inherent to the NEOWISE data set and cannot yet be interpreted as describing the true populations; the debiased size and albedo distributions will be the subject of the next paper in this series.},

Planetesimal populations in the Solar System which are most likely to survive the violent post-main-sequence evolution, such as the Kuiper Belt, display a large binary fraction with a propensity for near equal-mass components and provide a previously unexplored population of planetesimals which are likely to exist around white dwarfs. Here we simulate the dynamical evolution of equal-mass binary asteroid systems around white dwarfs using the N-body integrator REBOUND for 1 Gyr. We confirm that giant planets are efficient at dissociating and ejecting binary asteroid systems on eccentric orbits, while Earth-mass planets are better at keeping planetesimals in their planetary systems. We find binary systems can be dissociated and ejected from their systems across Myr timescales, producing interstellar objects. We do not expect a population of free-floating binary asteroid systems as all ejected planetesimals are gravitationally unbound from each other. Further, we discuss the influence of asteroid binarity on the white dwarf pollution process and find there is little to no impact on how close a body can get to a star. However, the orbital evolution of binary asteroids changes the distribution of planetesimals available in a white dwarf planetary system to be further scattered onto white dwarf polluting orbits.},

We investigate machine learning (ML) methods for automatically identifying these seasonal features in High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) satellite imagery. We designed deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that were trained and tested using the catalog generated by Planet Four, an online citizen science project mapping the south polar seasonal deposits. We validated the CNNs by comparing their results with those of ISODATA (Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique) clustering and as expected, the CNNs were significantly better at predicting the results found by Planet Four, in both the area of predicted seasonal deposits and in delineating their boundaries. We found neither the CNNs or ISODATA were suited to predicting the source point and directions of seasonal fans, which is a strength of the citizen science approach. The CNNs showed good agreement with Planet Four in cross-validation metrics and detected some seasonal deposits in the HiRISE images missed in the Planet Four catalog; the total area of seasonal deposits predicted by the CNNs was 27\% larger than that of the Planet Four catalog, but this aspect varied considerably on a per-image basis.},

  abstract = {Examining Arrokoth                            The New Horizons spacecraft flew past the Kuiper Belt object (486958) Arrokoth (also known as 2014 MU               69               ) in January 2019. Because of the great distance to the outer Solar System and limited bandwidth, it will take until late 2020 to downlink all the spacecraft's observations back to Earth. Three papers in this issue analyze recently downlinked data, including the highest-resolution images taken during the encounter (see the Perspective by Jewitt). Spencer               et al.               examined Arrokoth's geology and geophysics using stereo imaging, dated the surface using impact craters, and produced a geomorphological map. Grundy               et al.               investigated the composition of the surface using color imaging and spectroscopic data and assessed Arrokoth's thermal emission using microwave radiometry. McKinnon               et al.               used simulations to determine how Arrokoth formed: Two gravitationally bound objects gently spiraled together during the formation of the Solar System. Together, these papers determine the age, composition, and formation process of the most pristine object yet visited by a spacecraft.

Arrokoth is a member of the cold classical component of the Kuiper Belt, a population of dwarf planets and smaller bodies thought to be only modestly dynamically or collisionally disturbed, unlike the asteroids of the inner Solar System, comets, or other groups of Kuiper Belt objects. Data from this flyby provides the opportunity to observe the results of primordial planetesimal accretion, largely unobscured by later geological or dynamical processes.                                                        RATIONALE               Planetesimal formation is an unsolved problem in planetary science. Many mechanisms have been proposed in which small solid particles (dust and pebbles) agglomerate into planetesimals and ultimately into planets. The flyby of Arrokoth provides data that constrain planetesimal formation theories and allow us to construct models of Arrokoth's specific physical characteristics. The accretion processes that operated in the cold classical region of the Kuiper Belt during the formation of the Solar System are expected to have also occurred elsewhere in the protosolar nebula.               Arrokoth is a contact binary about 35 km long composed of two unequally sized lobes. Each lobe is flattened or lenticular in shape, and the planes of flattening of both (determined from their principal axes) are closely aligned, to within 5\textdegree. The smaller lobe is slightly oblong, with its long axis pointing down the long axis of the binary as a whole (to within 5\textdegree ). The surface and overall structure of Arrokoth do not display any obvious signs of catastrophic or subcatastrophic collision, and the join or neck between the two lobes is narrow. Each lobe is compositionally similar to within the precision of spectral measurements.                                         RESULTS                                We show that stresses in the neck region today are compatible with the structural integrity of Arrokoth for densities (several 100 kg m                 -3                 ) and material strengths (a few kilopascals) similar to those observed in comets, but at mass scales \textasciitilde 1000 times the mass of typical cometary nuclei. We performed numerical simulations of collisions between two bodies on the scale of the two lobes of Arrokoth, assuming those density and strength parameters. We found that impacts at or greater than their mutual escape speed (a few meters per second) would have been highly damaging. The close geometric alignment of the lobes is highly unlikely to the be the result of a chance collision alone but can be readily understood as the result of tidal evolution of a tight, co-orbiting binary. This requires a mechanism to extract angular momentum from the binary orbit, causing the orbit to shrink, and the two components to gently merge.                              Numerical models show that overdense concentrations of particles in the protosolar gas nebula can become gravitationally unstable and collapse to form planetesimals. The angular momentum in the simulated pebble clouds is high enough that formation of co-orbiting binaries is efficient and with binary characteristics that are a good match to binaries observed in the Kuiper Belt today. We examined a range of mechanisms to extract or transfer angular momentum from a co-orbiting binary and drive an ultimate merger, including mutual tides, tidal effects of the Sun (Kozai-Lidov oscillations), collisions with smaller Kuiper Belt objects, the ejection of third bodies, asymmetric radiation forces, and gas drag. We found that for bodies the size of Arrokoth, gas drag may be most effective in this merger process over the lifetime of the protosolar nebula.                                         CONCLUSION               We show that models of Arrokoth's formation and evolution support accretion of the binary through the gravitational collapse of an overdense pebble cloud in the presence of protosolar nebular gas, either as a contact binary initially or as a co-orbiting binary that later inspiraled and gently merged. Similar accretional processes and binary planetesimal formation likely occurred throughout the early Solar System.                                                   Simulated maximum accelerations experienced by particles during low-velocity impact of two spheres, approximating the scale of the two lobes of Arrokoth.                                        Spheres are modeled as granular aggregates with bulk densities of 500 kg m                     -3                     and an impact speed of 2.9 m s                     -1                     at a tangent angle of 80\textdegree; such gentle collisional conditions are necessary to preserve Arrokoth's overall undamaged shape. Extreme reds and blues correspond to the greatest and least maximum accelerations experienced, respectively. The maximum disturbance is concentrated in the narrow contact area, or neck, between the two bodies.                                                                                            ,                             The New Horizons spacecraft's encounter with the cold classical Kuiper Belt object (486958) Arrokoth (provisional designation 2014 MU               69               ) revealed a contact-binary planetesimal. We investigated how Arrokoth formed and found that it is the product of a gentle, low-speed merger in the early Solar System. Its two lenticular lobes suggest low-velocity accumulation of numerous smaller planetesimals within a gravitationally collapsing cloud of solid particles. The geometric alignment of the lobes indicates that they were a co-orbiting binary that experienced angular momentum loss and subsequent merger, possibly because of dynamical friction and collisions within the cloud or later gas drag. Arrokoth's contact-binary shape was preserved by the benign dynamical and collisional environment of the cold classical Kuiper Belt and therefore informs the accretion processes that operated in the early Solar System.},

A thorough understanding of cometary activity is closely coupled with knowledge about the formation of comets, thermal models of cometary nuclei, and chemistry in the coma. This chapter summarizes the specific chemical and physical changes that a comet nucleus undergoes, concentrating on the active phases. The specific drivers of activity are discussed, as well as the means of measuring the activity in comets. Finally, some historical and modern examples of specific types of cometary activity are discussed and are used to make inferences about both primordial differences between comet dynamical classes and evolutionary, or aging, effects.},

  abstract = {We argue that taxonomical concept development is vital for planetary science as in all branches of science, but its importance has been obscured by unique historical developments. The literature shows that the concept of planet developed by scientists during the Copernican Revolution was theory-laden and pragmatic for science. It included both primaries and satellites as planets due to their common intrinsic, geological characteristics. About two centuries later the non-scientific public had just adopted heliocentrism and was motivated to preserve elements of geocentrism including teleology and the assumptions of astrology. This motivated development of a folk concept of planet that contradicted the scientific view. The folk taxonomy was based on what an object orbits, making satellites out to be non-planets and ignoring most asteroids. Astronomers continued to keep primaries and moons classed together as planets and continued teaching that taxonomy until the 1920s. The astronomical community lost interest in planets ca. 1910 to 1955 and during that period complacently accepted the folk concept. Enough time has now elapsed so that modern astronomers forgot this history and rewrote it to claim that the folk taxonomy is the one that was created by the Copernican scientists. Starting ca. 1960 when spacecraft missions were developed to send back detailed new data, there was an explosion of publishing about planets including the satellites, leading to revival of the Copernican planet concept. We present evidence that taxonomical alignment with geological complexity is the most useful scientific taxonomy for planets. It is this complexity of both primary and secondary planets that is a key part of the chain of origins for life in the cosmos.},

This is an important topic to the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment, where excitation caused by the DART kinetic impact in the Didymos binary asteroid system may be reduced through dissipation before Hera arrives to survey the effects of the impact. We develop a numeric model for energy dissipation in binary asteroids to explore how different system configurations affect the rate of energy dissipation. We find tumbling within the synchronous state eliminates a systematic trend in libration damping on short timescales (several years), but not over long times (hundreds of years) depending on the material conditions. Furthermore, damping of libration, eccentricity, and fluctuations in the semimajor axis are primarily dependent on the stiffness of the secondary, whereas the semimajor axis secular expansion rate is dictated by the stiffness of the primary, as expected. Systems experiencing stable planar libration in the secondary can see a noticeable reduction in libration amplitude after only a few years depending on the stiffness of the secondary, and thus dissipation should be considered during Hera's survey of Didymos. For a very dissipative secondary undergoing stable libration, Hera may be able to calculate the rate of libration damping in Dimorphos and therefore constrain its tidal parameters.},

In late 2022, DART will collide with Dimorphos, the secondary in the Didymos binary asteroid system. The impact will cause a momentum transfer from the spacecraft to the binary asteroid, changing the orbit period of Dimorphos and forcing it to librate in its orbit. Owing to the coupled dynamics in binary asteroid systems, the orbit and libration state of Dimorphos are intertwined. Thus, as the secondary librates, it also experiences fluctuations in its orbit period. These variations in the orbit period are dependent on the magnitude of the impact perturbation, as well as the system's state at impact and the moments of inertia of the secondary. In general, any binary asteroid system whose secondary is librating will have a non-constant orbit period on account of the secondary's fluctuating spin rate. The orbit period variations are typically driven by two modes: a long-period and short-period, each with significant amplitudes on the order of tens of seconds to several minutes. The fluctuating orbit period offers both a challenge and an opportunity in the context of the DART mission. Orbit period oscillations will make determining the post-impact orbit period more difficult, but can also provide information about the system's libration state and the DART impact.},

  abstract = {We publicly release ATM, a Python package designed to model asteroid flux measurements to estimate an as\- teroid's size, surface temperature distribution, and emissivity. A number of the most popular static asteroid thermal models (NEATM, STM, FRM) are implemented with the reflected solar light contribution and Kirchhoff's law accounted for. Priors for fitted parameters can be easily specified and the solution, including the full multidimensional posterior probability density function, is found using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We describe the package's architecture and discuss model and fitting validation. Data files with \textasciitilde 10 million WISE flux measurements for \textasciitilde 150,000 unique asteroids and additional Minor Planet Center data are also included with the package, as well as Python Jupyter Notebooks with examples of how to select subsamples of objects, filter and process data, and use ATM to fit for the desired model parameters. The entirety of the analysis pre\- sented here, including all the figures, tables, and catalogs, can be easily reproduced with these publicly released Notebooks. We show that ATM can match the best-fit size estimates for well-observed asteroids published in 2016 by the NEOWISE team (Mainzer et al., 2016) with a sub-percent bias and a scatter of only 6\%. Our analysis of various sources of random and systematic size uncertainties shows that for the majority of over 100,000 objects with WISE-based size estimates random uncertainties (precision) are about 10\%; systematic uncertainties within the adopted model framework, such as NEATM, and with assumed emissivity for WISE W3 and W4 bands, are likely in the range of 10\textendash 20\%. Hence, the accuracy of WISE-based asteroid size estimates is approximately in the range of 15\textendash 20\% for most objects, except for unknown errors due to a possibly over-simplified modeling framework (e.g., spherical asteroid approximation). We compare model families to data in WISE color-color diagrams and derive a simple method to estimate size that only uses WISE W3 band flux; we show that it matches estimates based on all four WISE bands to within 10\%. We also study optical data collected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and show that correlations of optical colors and WISE-based best-fit model parameters indicate robustness of the latter. Our analysis gives support to the claim by Harris \& Drube (2014) that candidate metallic asteroids can be selected using the best-fit temperature parameter and infrared albedo. We investigate a correlation between SDSS colors and optical albedo derived using WISE-based size estimates and show that this correlation can be used to estimate asteroid sizes with optical data alone, with a precision of about 17\% relative to WISE-based size estimates. After accounting for systematic errors, the difference in accuracy between infrared and optical color-based size estimates becomes less than a factor of two.},

We use a statistical approach to identify asteroids on orbits that resemble those of short-period near-Earth comets (NECs) using the Tisserand parameter with respect to Jupiter, the aphelion distance, and the minimum orbital intersection distance with respect to Jupiter. From the sample of NEAs on comet-like orbits, we select those with a geometric albedo pV  0.064 as dormant comet candidates, and find that only {$\sim$}50\% of NEAs on comet-like orbits also have comet-like albedos. We identify a total of 23 NEAs from our sample that are likely to be dormant short-period NECs and, based on a de-biasing procedure applied to the cryogenic NEOWISE survey, estimate both magnitudelimited and size-limited fractions of the NEA population that are dormant short-period comets.

From the sparsely sampled G-band photometry, we derive lower-limit light curve amplitudes for 11665 main belt asteroids (MBA) in order to provide constraints on the distribution of shapes in the asteroid main belt. Assuming a triaxial shape model for each asteroid, defined through the axial aspect ratios a {$>$} b and b = c, we find an average b/a = 0.80 {$\pm$} 0.04 for the ensemble, which is in agreement with previous results. By combining the Gaia data with asteroid properties from the literature, we investigate possible correlations of the aspect ratio with size, semimajor axis, geometric albedo, and intrinsic color. Based on our model simulations, we find that MBAs greater than 50 km in diameter on average have higher b/a aspect ratios (are rounder) than smaller asteroids. We furthermore find significant differences in the shape distribution of MBAs as a function of the other properties that do not affect the average aspect ratios. We conclude that a more detailed investigation of shape distribution correlations requires a larger data sample than is provided in Gaia Data Release 2.},

  abstract = {With the advent of large-scale astronomical surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), the number of alerts generated by transient, variable and moving astronomical objects is growing rapidly, reaching millions per night. Concerning solar system minor planets, their identification requires linking the alerts of many observations over a potentially large time, leading to a very large combinatorial number. This work aims to identify new candidates for solar system objects from massive alert data streams produced by large-scale surveys, such as the ZTF and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Our analysis used the Fink alert broker capabilities to reduce the 111,275,131 processed alerts from ZTF between November 2019 and December 2022 to only 389,530 new solar system alert candidates over the same period. We then implemented a linking algorithm, Fink-FAT, to create real-time trajectory candidates from alert data and extract orbital parameters. The analysis was validated on ZTF alert packets linked to confirmed solar system objects from the Minor Planet Center database. Finally, the results were confronted against follow-up observations. Between November 2019 and December 2022, Fink-FAT extracted 327 new orbits from solar system object candidates at the time of the observations, over which 65 were still unreported in the MPC database as of March 2023. After two late follow-up observation campaigns of six orbit candidates, four were associated with known solar system minor planets, and two remain unknown. Fink-FAT is deployed in the Fink broker and successfully analyzes in real time the alert data from the ZTF survey by regularly extracting new candidates for solar system objects. Our scalability tests also show that Fink-FAT can handle the even larger volume of alert data that the Rubin Observatory will send.},

  abstract = {How big were the first planetesimals? We attempt to answer this question by conducting coagulation simulations in which the planetesimals grow by mutual collisions and form larger bodies and planetary embryos. The size frequency distribution (SFD) of the initial planetesimals is considered a free parameter in these simulations, and we search for the one that produces at the end objects with a SFD that is consistent with Asteroid belt constraints. We find that, if the initial planetesimals were small (e.g. km-sized), the final SFD fails to fulfill these constraints. In particular, reproducing the bump observed at diameter D \$ 100 km in the current SFD of the asteroids requires that the minimal size of the initial planetesimals was also \$100 km. This supports the idea that planetesimals formed big, namely that the size of solids in the proto-planetary disk ``jumped'' from sub-meter scale to multi-kilometer scale, without passing through intermediate values. Moreover, we find evidence that the initial planetesimals had to have sizes ranging from 100 to several 100 km, probably even 1000 km, and that their SFD had to have a slope over this interval that was similar to the one characterizing the current asteroids in the same size range. This result sets a new constraint on planetesimal formation models and opens new perspectives for the investigation of the collisional evolution in the Asteroid and Kuiper belts as well as of the accretion of the cores of the giant planets.},

We don't find any statistically significant evidence that the albedo distribution of NEOs depends on NEO size.

The interval between kmsized bodies striking the Earth should occur on average once every 750,000 years. Low and high albedo NEOs are well mixed in orbital space, but a trend remains with higher albedo objects being at smaller semimajor axes and lower albedo objects more likely found at larger semimajor axes.},

Based on the mass and speed of the impactor, and using known scaling laws, the total mass ejected can be roughly estimated. Then, with the aim to provide approximate expected brightness levels of the coma and tail extent and morphology, we have propagated the orbits of the particles ejected by integrating their equation of motion, and have used a Monte Carlo approach to study the evolution of the coma and tail brightness. For typical power-law particle size distribution of index --3.5, with radii r\$\_\{rmin\}\$=1 \$\textbackslash mu\$m and r\$\_\{max\}\$=1 cm, and ejection speeds near 10 times the escape velocity of Dimorphos, we predict an increase of brightness of \$\textbackslash sim\$3 magnitudes right after the impact, and a decay to pre-impact levels some 10 days after.

However, if most of the ejecta is released at speeds of the order of \$\textbackslash gtrsim\$100 \$\textbackslash mathrm\{m\textbackslash; s\^\{-1\}\}\$, the observability of the event would reduce to a very short time span, of the order of one day or shorter.},

  abstract = {Stellar occultation is a powerful technique that allows the determination of some physical parameters of the occulting object. The result depends on the photometric accuracy, the temporal resolution, and the number of chords obtained. Space telescopes can achieve high photometric accuracy as they are not affected by atmospheric scintillation. Using ESA's CHEOPS space telescope, we observed a stellar occultation by the Transneptunian object (50000) Quaoar. We compare the obtained chord with previous occultations by this object and determine its astrometry with sub-milliarcsecond precision. Also, we determine upper limits to the presence of a global methane atmosphere on the occulting body. We predicted and observed a stellar occultation by Quaoar using the CHEOPS space telescope. We measured the occultation light curve from this data-set and determined the dis- and re-appearance of the star behind the occulting body. Furthermore, a ground-based telescope in Australia was used to constrain Quaoar's limb. Combined with results from previous works, these measurements allow us to obtain a precise position of Quaoar at the occultation time. We present results obtained from the first stellar occultation by a Transneptunian object (TNO) using space telescope orbiting Earth. It was the occultation by Quaoar observed on 2020 June 11. We used the CHEOPS light curve to obtain a surface pressure upper limit of 85 nbar for the detection of a global methane atmosphere. Also, combining this observation with a ground-based observation we fit Quaoar's limb to determine its astrometric position with an uncertainty below 1.0 mas. This observation is a first of its kind, and it shall be considered as a proof of concept of stellar occultation observations of Transneptunian objects with space telescopes orbiting Earth. Moreover, it shows significant prospects for the James Webb Space Telescope.},

  abstract = {Mid-infrared (5 micron to 25 micron) transmission/absorption spectra of differentiated meteorites (achondrites) were measured to permit comparison with astronomical observations of dust in different stages of evolution of young stellar objects. In contrast to primitive chondrites, achondrites underwent heavy metamorphism and/or extensive melting and represent more advanced stages of planetesimal evolution. Spectra were obtained from primitive achondrites (acapulcoite, winonaite, ureilite, and brachinite) and differentiated achondrites (eucrite, diogenite, aubrite, and mesosiderite silicates). The ureilite and brachinite show spectra dominated by olivine features, and the diogenite and aubrite by pyroxene features. The acapulcoite, winonaite, eucrite, and mesosiderite silicates exhibit more complex spectra, reflecting their multi-phase bulk mineralogy. Mixtures of spectra of the primitive achondrites and differentiated achondrites in various proportions show good similarities to the spectra of the few Myr old protoplanetary disks HD104237A and V410 Anon 13. A spectrum of the differentiated mesosiderite silicates is similar to the spectra of the mature debris disks HD172555 and HD165014. A mixture of spectra of the primitive ureilite and brachinite is similar to the spectrum of the debris disk HD113766. The results raise the possibility that materials produced in the early stage of planetesimal differentiation occur in the protoplanetary and debris disks.},

The laboratory spectra of the Murchison samples exhibit characteristic changes in the infrared features. A weakly shocked sample (shocked at 10 GPa) shows almost no changes from the unshocked sample dominated by hydrous silicate (serpentine). Moderately shocked samples (21 to 34 GPa) have typical serpentine features gradually replaced by bands of amorphous material and olivine with increasing shock pressure. A strongly shocked sample (36 GPa) shows major changes due to decomposition of the serpentine and due to devolatilization. A shock melted sample (49 GPa) shows features of olivine recrystallized from melted material. The spectra of highly shocked Murchison samples (36 and 49 GPa) are similar to those of dust in the debris disks of HD113766 and HD69830, and the transitional disk of HD100546. The moderately shocked samples (21 to 34 GPa) exhibit spectra similar to those of dust in the debris disks of Beta Pictoris and BD+20307, and the transitional disk of GM Aur. An average of the spectra of all Murchison samples (0 to 49 GPa) has a similarity to the spectrum of the older protoplanetary disk of SU Auriga. In the gas-rich transitional and protoplanetary disks, the abundances of amorphous silicates and gases have widely been considered to be a primary property. However, our study suggests that impact processing may play a significant role in generating secondary amorphous silicates and gases in those disks. Infrared spectra of the shocked Murchison samples are also suggesting that the comets also contain shocked Murchison-like material.},

  abstract = {Methods. We used both TRAPPIST telescopes to monitor the comet for almost a year with broad and narrow-band filters. We derived the production rates of five gaseous species (OH, NH, CN, C3, and C2) using a Haser model as well as the A(\texttheta )f{$\rho$} dust proxy parameter. The comet was also observed with the two optical high-resolution spectrographs UVES and ESPRESSO, mounted on the 8-m ESO VLT, to measure the isotopic ratios of C and N, along with the oxygen forbidden-line ratios and the NH2 ortho-to-para ratios. Results. Over nearly a year, we followed the rise and decline of the production rates of different species as well as the dust activity of 46P on both pre- and post-perihelion. Relative abundances with respect to CN and OH along the orbit of the comet show constant and symmetric abundance ratios and a typical coma composition. We determined the rotation period of the nucleus using high-cadence observations and long series of CN images on several nights. We obtained a value of (9.18{$\pm$}0.05) hours at perihelion. Using the high-resolution spectra of 46P coma, we derived C and N isotopic ratios of 100{$\pm$}20 and 150{$\pm$}30 as well as a green-to-red forbidden oxygen [OI] line ratio of 0.23{$\pm$}0.02. We measured a NH2 ortho-to-para ratio of 3.31{$\pm$}0.03 and derived an ammonia ratio of 1.19{$\pm$}0.03, corresponding to a spin temperature of 27{$\pm$}1 K. Conclusions. Narrow-band observations show that comet 46P is a hyperactive comet for which 40\% of its nucleus surface is active. It has a typical composition, similar to other normal comets; however, an asymmetric behavior with respect to perihelion has been seen in its activity, which is typical of seasonal effects. Photometric measurements show no evidence for a change in the rotation period of the nucleus during this apparition. High-resolution spectra show that 46P has typical NH2 ortho-to-para, [OI] lines ratios, and C and N isotopic ratios.},

Comet 21P is a well-known member of the carbon-chain-depleted family, but also displays a depletion of amines. We continuously monitored the comet over more than seven months with the two TRAPPIST telescopes (TN and TS), covering a wide heliocentric distance range from 1.60 au inbound to 2.10 au outbound with a perihelion at 1.01 au on September 10, 2018. We computed and followed the evolution of the dust- (represented by A f {$\rho$}) and gas-production rates of the daughter species OH, NH, CN, C3, and C2 and their relative abundances to OH and to CN over the cometary orbit. We compared them to those measured in the previous apparitions. The activity of the comet and its water production rate reached a maximum of (3.72 {$\pm$} 0.07) \texttimes{} 1028 mol s-1 on August 17, 2018 (rh = 1.07 au), 24 days before perihelion. The peak value of A(0) f {$\rho$} was reached on the same date (1646 {$\pm$} 13) cm in the red filter. Using a sublimation model for the nucleus, we constrained the active surface of the nucleus using the slow-rotator model. The abundance ratios of the various species are remarkably constant over a wide range of heliocentric distances before and after perihelion, showing a high level of homogeneity of the ices in the surface of the nucleus. The behaviour and level of the activity of the comet is also remarkably similar over the last five orbits. In the coma dust colour, 21P shows reflective gradients similar to JFCs. We obtained a high-resolution spectrum of 21P with UVES at ESO Very Large Telescope one week after perihelion. Using the CN B-X (0, 0) violet band, we measured 12C/13C and 14N/15N isotopic ratios of 100 {$\pm$} 10 and 145 {$\pm$} 10, respectively, both in very good agreement with the ratios commonly found in comets. We measured an ortho-para abundance ratio of NH3 of 1.16 {$\pm$} 0.02, corresponding to a nuclear spin temperature of Tspin = 27 {$\pm$} 1 K, which is similar to other comets. While the abundance ratios in the gaseous coma reveal a peculiar composition, the isotopic and ortho-to-para ratios appear entirely normal. We performed a dynamical simulation of 21P and found that it is likely a young member of the JFC population. We favour a pristine composition scenario to explain the chemical peculiarities of this comet.},

This precision will play an important role for the mass determination of about hundred minor planets with a relative precision better than 50\%. Presently, due primarily to their perturbations on Mars, the uncertainty in the masses of the largest asteroids is the limiting factor in the accuracy of the solar system ephemerides. Besides, such high precision astrometry will enable to derive direct measurements of the masses of the largest asteroids which are of utmost significance for the knowledge of their physical properties. The method for computing the masses is based on the analysis of orbital perturbations during close encounters between massive asteroids (perturbers) and several smaller minor planets (targets). From given criteria of close approaches selection, we give the list of asteroids for which the mass can be determined, and the expected precision of these masses at mission completion. We next study the possible contribution of the ground-based observations for the mass determination in some special observation cases of close approaches.},

We utilized these least-squares solutions to construct a proposal probability density for MCMC sampling. For inverse methods involving triaxial ellipsoids, we update the uncertainty model for the observations. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We demonstrate the utilization of the inverse methods for three asteroids with Gaia photometry from Data Release 2: (21) Lutetia, (26) Proserpina, and (585) Bilkis. First, we validated the convex inverse methods using the combined ground-based and Gaia data for Lutetia, arriving at rotation and shape models in agreement with those derived with the help of Rosetta space mission data. Second, we applied the convex inverse methods to Proserpina and Bilkis, illustrating the potential of the Gaia photometry for setting constraints on asteroid light scattering as a function of the phase angle (the Sun-object-observer angle). Third, with the help of triaxial ellipsoid inversion as applied to Gaia photometry only, we provide additional proof that the absolute Gaia photometry alone can yield meaningful photometric slope parameters. Fourth, for (585) Bilkis, we report, with 1-{$\sigma$} uncertainties, a refined rotation period of (8.5750559 {$\pm$} 0.0000026) h, pole longitude of 320.6\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 1.2\textdegree, pole latitude of - 25.6\textdegree{} {$\pm$} 1.7\textdegree, and the first shape model and its uncertainties from convex inversion. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: We conclude that the inverse methods provide realistic uncertainty estimators for the lightcurve inversion problem and that the Gaia photometry can provide an asteroid taxonomy based on the phase curves.},

  abstract = {Photometry is an important tool for characterizing the physical properties of asteroids. An asteroid's photometric lightcurve and phase curve refer to the variation of the asteroid's disk-integrated brightness in time and in phase angle (the Sun-asteroid-observer angle), respectively. They depend on the asteroid's shape, rotation, and surface scattering properties, and the geometry of illumination and observation. We present Bayesian lightcurve inversion methods for the retrieval of the asteroid's phase function, the unambiguous phase curve of a spherical object with surface scattering properties equal to those of the asteroid. A collection of such phase functions can give rise to a photometric taxonomy for asteroids. In the inverse problem, first, there are four classes of lightcurves that require individual error models. The photometric observations can be absolute or relative and they can have dense or sparse cadence in comparison to the rotation period of the asteroid. Second, the observations extend over varying phase angle ranges, requiring different phase function models. Asteroid photometry from the European Space Agency Gaia space mission extends, typically, over a range of phase angles, where the phase curve tends to be linear on the magnitude scale. Photometry from groundbased observing programs can reach small phase angles, where the asteroids show an opposition effect, a nonlinear increase of brightness on the magnitude scale towards zero phase angle. We provide error models for all four classes of lightcurves and make use of linear or linear-exponential phase functions for phase angles below 50\textdegree. We apply the inverse methods to sparse absolute Gaia and dense relative ground-based lightcurves and obtain absolute magnitudes and phase functions, with uncertainties, for \textasciitilde 500 asteroids. Finally, we assess the lightcurve inversion problem for dense absolute photometry with the help of a numerical simulation for a Gaussian-random-sphere asteroid.},

  abstract = {We review progress in the photometric and polarimetric observations of asteroids, including theoretical and experimental advances in interpreting scattering and absorption of light by asteroid surfaces. Photometric phase effects, such as the opposition effect, the overall phase function, and the so-called amplitude-phase relationship, provide insight into local physical characteristics of the surface, e.g., surface roughness and porosity, and single-particle geometrical and optical properties. Polarimetric phase effects, the negative degree of linear polarization in particular, unveil single-particle properties beyond those derivable from photometry. In order to make progress in the interpretation of the observations, it is obligatory to consider the full vector nature of light, as dictated by Maxwell's equations. We review the primary physical mechanisms for the opposition effect and the negative linear polarization. The coherent backscattering mechanism has been established to contribute to the observed opposition effects and negative linear polarizations. The traditional shadowing mechanism explanation of the opposition effect has been studied via extensive computer simulations. Laboratory photometric and polarimetric experiments with regolith-simulating samples provide an invaluable test bench for theoretical modeling. We review the progress in laboratory work, emphasizing the need for experiments with well-documented samples. We show simultaneous heuristic coherent-backscattering modeling of asteroid photometric and polarimetric phase effects for different asteroid classes. The recent findings imply enhanced future utilization of the phase effects for the benefit of asteroid science.},

  abstract = {Infrared measurements of asteroids are crucial for the determination of physical and thermal properties of individual objects, and for the understanding of the small-body populations in the solar system as a whole. But standard radiometric methods can only be applied if the orbit of an object is known, hence its position at the time of the observation. We present MIRI observations of the outer-belt asteroid 10920 and an unknown object, detected in all 9 MIRI bands in close proximity to 10920. We developed a new method "STM-ORBIT" to interpret the multi-band measurements without knowing the object's true location. The method leads to a confirmation of radiometric size-albedo solution for 10920 and puts constraints on the asteroid's location and orbit in agreement with its true orbit. Groundbased lightcurve observations of 10920, combined with Gaia data, indicate a very elongated object (a/b {$>$}= 1.5), with a spin-pole at (l, b) = (178\{\textbackslash deg\}, 81\{\textbackslash deg\}), and a rotation period of 4.861191 h. A thermophysical study leads to a size of 14.5 - 16.5 km, a geometric albedo between 0.05 and 0.10, and a thermal inertia in the range 9 to 35 Jm-2s-0.5K-1. For the newly discovered MIRI object, the STM-ORBIT method revealed a size of 100-230 m. The new asteroid must be on a very low-inclination orbit and it was located in the inner main-belt region during JWST observations. A beaming parameter \{\textbackslash eta\} larger than 1.0 would push the size even below 100 meter, a main-belt regime which escaped IR detections so far. These kind of MIRI observations can therefore contribute to formation and evolution studies via classical size-frequency studies which are currently limited to objects larger than about one kilometer in size. We estimate that MIRI frames with pointings close to the ecliptic and only short integration times of a few seconds will always include a few asteroids, most of them will be unknown objects.},

  abstract = {Cometary nuclei contain the least modified material from the formative epoch of our planetary system, and their compositions reflect a range of processes experienced by material prior to its incorporation in the cometary nucleus. Dynamical models suggest that icy bodies in the main cometary reservoirs (Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud) formed in a range of environments in the protoplanetary disk, and (for the Oort Cloud) even in disks surrounding neighboring stars of the Sun's birth cluster. Photometric and spectroscopic surveys of more than 100 comets have enabled taxonomic groupings based on free radical species and on crystallinity of rocky grains. Since 1985, new surveys have provided emerging taxonomies based on the abundance ratios of primary volatiles. More than 20 primary chemical species are now detected in bright comets. Measurements of nuclear spin ratios (in water, ammonia, and methane) and of isotopic ratios (D/H in water and HCN; 14N/15N in CN and HCN) have provided critical insights on factors affecting formation of the primary species. The identification of an abundant product species (HNC) has provided clear evidence of chemical production in the inner coma. Parallel advances have occurred in astrochemistry of hot corinos, circumstellar disks, and dense cloud cores. In this review, we address the current state of cometary taxonomy and compare it with current astrochemical insights.},

  abstract = {The distinctive set of Saturnian small satellites, Aegaeon, Methone, Anthe, and Pallene, constitutes an excellent laboratory to understand the evolution of systems immersed in coorbital dusty rings/arcs, subjected to perturbations from larger satellites and non-gravitational forces. In this work, we carried out a comprehensive numerical exploration of the longterm evolution of Pallene and its ring. Through frequency map analysis, we characterised the current dynamical state around Pallene. A simple tidal evolution model serves to set a time frame for the current orbital configuration of the system. With detailed short and long-term N-body simulations we determine whether Pallene is currently in resonance with one or more of six of Saturn's major moons. We analysed a myriad of resonant arguments extracted from the direct and indirect parts of the disturbing function, finding that Pallene is not in mean motion resonance from the present up to 5 Myr into the future; nonetheless, some resonant arguments exhibit intervals of libration and circulation at different timescales and moon pairings. We studied the dynamical evolution of micrometric particles forming the ring, considering gravitational and non-gravitational forces. Non-gravitational forces are responsible for particles vertical excursions and outward migration. By estimating the satellite's mass production rate, we find that Pallene could be responsible for keeping its ring in steadystate only if it is mainly composed of large micrometre-sized particles. If mainly composed of particles with a few micrometres for which Pallene is the only source, the ring will spread out, both radially and vertically, until it finally disappears.},

We also used these diameter values in conjunction with absolute visual magnitudes to infer estimates of visibleband geometric albedos. We provide solutions to 131 asteroids not analyzed by the NEOWISE team and to 1,778 asteroids not analyzed with 4-band data by the NEOWISE team. Our process differs from the NEOWISE analysis in that it uses an accurate solar flux, integrates the flux with actual bandpass responses, obeys Kirchhoff's law, and does not force emissivity values in all four bands to an arbitrary value of 0.9. We used a regularized model fitting algorithm that yields improved fits to the data. Our results more closely match stellar occultation diameter estimates than the NEOWISE results by a factor of {$\sim$}2. Using 24 high-quality stellar occultation results as a benchmark, we found that the median error of 4-infrared-band diameter estimates in a carefully curated data set is 9.3\%. Our results also suggest the presence of a size-dependent bias in the NEOWISE diameter estimates, which may pollute estimates of asteroid size distributions and slightly inflate impact hazard risk calculations. For more than 90\% of asteroids in this sample, the primary source of error on the albedo estimate is the error on absolute visual magnitude.},

We estimate that the period of the mutual orbit at the epoch 2022 September 26.0 TDB, the day of the DART impact, is \$11.9214869 \textbackslash pm 0.000028\$\textasciitilde h (\$1\textbackslash sigma\$) and that the mean motion of the orbit is changing at a rate of \$(5.0\textbackslash pm 1.0)\textbackslash times 10\^\{-18\}\$\textasciitilde rad s\$\^\{-2\}\$ \$(1\textbackslash sigma\$). The formal \$3\textbackslash sigma\$ uncertainty in orbital phase of Dimorphos during the planned Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission is \$5.4\^\textbackslash circ\$. Observations from July to September 2022, a few months to days prior to the DART impact, should provide modest improvements to the orbital phase uncertainty and reduce it to about \$4.2\^\textbackslash circ\$. These results, generated using a relatively simple model, are consistent with those generated using the more sophisticated model of \textbackslash citet\{scheirich22\}, which demonstrates the reliability of our method and adds confidence to these mission-critical results.},

Here, we lay the analytical foundation of the study of the inclination pathways of planet-crossing asteroids that explains these findings. We show that the Tisserand relation partitions the inclination-semi-major axis parameter space of the three-body problem into distinct regions depending on the asteroid's Tisserand parameter T or equivalently its orbital inclination I{$\infty$} far from the planet. The Tisserand relation shows that asteroids with I{$\infty$} {$>$} 110{$\smwhtcircle$} (T {$<$} -1) cannot be injected inside the planet's orbit. Injection onto retrograde orbits and high-inclination prograde orbits occurs inside the inclination corridor 45{$\smwhtcircle$} I{$\infty$} 110{$\smwhtcircle$} (-1 T 2). Inclination dispersion across the inclination pathway for moderate and high inclinations is explained by the secular perturbations from the planet and is smallest for polar orbits. When a planet-crossing asteroid temporarily leaves the inclination pathway, its long term evolution still depends on its Tisserand parameter as evidenced by its eccentricity dispersion. Simulations of asteroid orbits using the equations of motion with Neptune as the perturbing planet confirm these results for moderate to high inclinations, forward and backward in time because the Tisserand relation is time-independent. The Tisserand inclination pathways will provide important constraints on comet delivery from the outer solar system as well as on the possible presence of unknown planets in trans-neptunian space.},

The resulting velocity-dependent cross section can then be convolved with any distribution of relative speeds to determine the capture rate for incoming bodies. This convolution is carried out for the usual Maxwellian distribution, as well as the velocity distribution expected for rocky debris ejected from planetary systems.

At least nine impact episodes are identified, with durations whose upper limits are set by the dating accuracy of the craters. Their amplitudes and frequency are inconsistent with an origin in asteroid breakups or Oort cloud disturbances, but are consistent with the arrival and disintegration in near-Earth orbits of rare, giant comets, mainly in transit from the Centaur population into the Jupiter family and Encke regions. About 1 in 10 Centaurs in Chiron-like orbits enter Earth-crossing epochs, usually repeatedly, each such epoch being generally of a few thousand years' duration. On time-scales of geological interest, debris from their breakup may increase the mass of the near-Earth interplanetary environment by two or three orders of magnitude, yielding repeated episodes of bombardment and stratospheric dusting. I find a strong correlation between these bombardment episodes and major biostratigraphic and geological boundaries, and propose that episodes of extinction are most effectively driven by prolonged encounters with meteoroid streams during bombardment episodes. Possible mechanisms are discussed.},

They can grow by accreting material to become full-size planets. Planetesimals themselves are thought to form by complex physical processes from small grains in protoplanetary disks. The streaming instability (SI) model states that millimeter/centimeter-sized particles (pebbles) are aerodynamically collected into self-gravitating clouds that then directly collapse into planetesimals. Here we analyze ATHENA simulations of the SI to characterize the initial properties (e.g., rotation) of pebble clouds. Their gravitational collapse is followed with the PKDGRAV Nbody code, which has been modified to realistically account for pebble collisions. We find that pebble clouds rapidly collapse into short-lived disk structures from which planetesimals form. The planetesimal properties depend on the cloud's scaled angular momentum, l = L (MRH2 W), where L and M are the angular momentum and mass, RH is the Hill radius, and {$\Omega$} is the orbital frequency. Low-l pebble clouds produce tight (or contact) binaries and single planetesimals. Compact high-l clouds give birth to binary planetesimals with attributes that closely resemble the equally sized binaries found in the Kuiper Belt. Significantly, the SI-triggered gravitational collapse can explain the angular momentum distribution of known equally sized binaries\textemdash a result pending verification from studies with improved resolution. About 10\% of collapse simulations produce hierarchical systems with two or more large moons. These systems should be found in the Kuiper Belt when observations reach the threshold sensitivity.},

The capture occurs in this model when Jupiter's orbit and its Lagrange points become radially displaced in a scattering event and fall into a region populated by planetesimals (that previously evolved from their natal transplanetary disk to {$\sim$}5 AU during the instability). Our numerical simulations of the new capture model, hereafter jump capture, satisfactorily reproduce the orbital distribution of the Trojans and their total mass. The jump capture is potentially capable of explaining the observed asymmetry in the number of leading and trailing Trojans. We find that the capture probability is (6\textendash 8) \texttimes{} 10-7 for each particle in the original transplanetary disk, implying that the disk contained (3\textendash 4) \texttimes{} 107 planetesimals with absolute magnitude H {$<$} 9 (corresponding to diameter D = 80 km for a 7\% albedo). The disk mass inferred from this work, Mdisk {$\sim$} 14\textendash 28 MEarth, is consistent with the mass deduced from recent dynamical simulations of the planetary instability.},

The cold classical objects at radial distance r=42-47 au from the Sun are predominantly very red (spectral slope s{$>$}17\%) and often exist as equal-size binaries (\textasciitilde 30\% observed binary fraction). This has been taken as evidence for the in-situ formation of cold classicals. Interestingly, a small fraction (\textasciitilde 10\%) of cold classicals is less red with s{$<$}17\%, and these "blue" bodies are often found in wide binaries. Here we study the dynamical implantation of blue binaries from r{$<$}42 au. We find that they can be implanted into the cold classical belt from a wide range of initial radial distances, but the survival of the widest blue binaries -- 2001 QW322 and 2003 UN284 -- implies formation at r{$>$}30 au. This would be consistent with the hypothesized less-red to very-red transition at 30},

  abstract = {A large fraction of {$\sim$}100 km class low-inclination objects in the classical Kuiper Belt (KB) are binaries with comparable masses and a wide separation of components. A favored model for their formation is that they were captured during the coagulation growth of bodies in the early KB. However, recent studies have suggested that large, 100 km objects can rapidly form in the protoplanetary disks when swarms of locally concentrated solids collapse under their own gravity. Here, we examine the possibility that KB binaries formed during gravitational collapse when the excess of angular momentum prevented the agglomeration of available mass into a solitary object. We find that this new mechanism provides a robust path toward the formation of KB binaries with observed properties, and can explain wide systems such as 2001 QW322 and multiples such as (47171) 1999 TC36. Notably, the gravitational collapse is capable of producing {$\sim$}100\% binary fraction for a wide range of the swarm's initial angular momentum values. The binary components have similar masses ({$\sim$}80\% have a secondary-over-primary radius ratio {$>$}0.7) and their separation ranges from {$\sim$}1000 to {$\sim$}100,000 km. The binary orbits have eccentricities from e = 0 to {$\sim$}1, with the majority having e {$<$} 0.6. The binary orbit inclinations with respect to the initial angular momentum of the swarm range from i = 0 to {$\sim$}90{$\smwhtcircle$}, with most cases having i {$<$} 50{$\smwhtcircle$}. The total binary mass represents a characteristic fraction of the collapsing swarm's total initial mass, Mtot, suggesting Mtot equivalent to that of a radius {$\sim$}100\textendash 250 km compact object. Our binary formation mechanism also implies that the primary and secondary components in each binary pair should have identical bulk composition, which is consistent with the current photometric data. We discuss the applicability of our results to the Pluto\textendash Charon, Orcus\textendash Vanth, (617) Patroclus\textendash Menoetius, and (90) Antiope binary systems.},

The basin-forming impactors were suspected to be asteroids released from an inner extension of the main belt (1.8-2.0 au).

The number of basins expected from impacts of leftover planetesimals largely exceeds the number of known lunar basins, suggesting that the first 200 Myr of impacts is not recorded on the lunar surface. The Imbrium basin formation (age 3.92 Gyr; impactor diameter d\textasciitilde 100 km) occurs with a 15-35\% probability in our model. Imbrium must have formed unusually late to have only two smaller basins (Orientale and Schrodinger) forming afterwards.

A particularly puzzling and up-tonow unexplained feature of the Kuiper Belt is the so-called ``kernel,'' a concentration of orbits with semimajor axes a ; 44 AU, eccentricities e {$\sim$} 0.05, and inclinations i {$<$} 5. Here we show that the Kuiper Belt kernel can be explained if Neptune's otherwise smooth migration was interrupted by a discontinuous change of Neptune's semimajor axis when Neptune reached ;28 AU. Before the discontinuity happened, planetesimals located at {$\sim$}40 AU were swept into Neptune's 2:1 resonance, and were carried with the migrating resonance outwards. The 2:1 resonance was at ;44 AU when Neptune reached ;28 AU. If Neptune's semimajor axis changed by fraction of AU at this point, perhaps because Neptune was scattered off of another planet, the 2:1 population would have been released at ;44 AU, and would remain there to this day. We show that the orbital distribution of bodies produced in this model provides a good match to the orbital properties of the kernel. If Neptune migration was conveniently slow after the jump, the sweeping 2:1 resonance would deplete the population of bodies at ;45\textendash 47 AU, thus contributing to the paucity of the lowinclination orbits in this region. Special provisions, probably related to inefficiencies in the accretional growth of sizable objects, are still needed to explain why only a few low-inclination bodies have been so far detected beyond ;47 AU.},

  abstract = {Several properties of the solar system, including the wide radial spacing and orbital eccentricities of giant planets, can be explained if the early solar system evolved through a dynamical instability followed by migration of planets in the planetesimal disk. Here we report the results of a statistical study, in which we performed nearly 104 numerical simulations of planetary instability starting from hundreds of different initial conditions. We found that the dynamical evolution is typically too violent, if Jupiter and Saturn start in the 3:2 resonance, leading to ejection of at least one ice giant from the solar system. Planet ejection can be avoided if the mass of the transplanetary disk of planetesimals was large (Mdisk 50 MEarth), but we found that a massive disk would lead to excessive dynamical damping (e.g., final e55 0.01 compared to present e55 = 0.044, where e55 is the amplitude of the fifth eccentric mode in the Jupiter's orbit), and to smooth migration that violates constraints from the survival of the terrestrial planets. Better results were obtained when the solar system was assumed to have five giant planets initially, and one ice giant, with mass comparable to that of Uranus and Neptune, was ejected into interstellar space by Jupiter. The best results were obtained when the ejected planet was placed into the external 3:2 or 4:3 resonance with Saturn and Mdisk 20 MEarth. The range of possible outcomes is rather broad in this case, indicating that the present solar system is neither a typical nor expected result for a given initial state, and occurs, in best cases, with only a 5\% probability (as defined by the success criteria described in the main text). The case with six giant planets shows interesting dynamics but does offer significant advantages relative to the five-planet case.},

We calculated energy balance in bodies heated by radioactive decay and compaction-driven water-rock separation in a three-component dust-water/ice-empty pores mixture, while also taking into consideration second-order processes, such as accretional heating, hydrothermal circulation, and ocean or ice convection. Calculations were performed for varying accretion duration, final size, surface temperature, and dust/ice ratio to survey the range of possible internal states for precursors of Ceres. Subsequently, the evolution of Ceres was considered in five sets of simulated models, covering different accretion and evolution orbits and dust/ice ratios. Results. We find that Ceres' precursors in the inner solar system could have been both wet and dry, while in the Kuiper belt, they retain the bulk of their water content. For plausible accretion scenarios, a thick primordial crust may be retained over several Gyr, following a slow differentiation within a few hundreds of Myr, assuming an absence of destabilizing impacts. The resulting thermal conditions at present allow for various salt solutions at depths of 10 km. The warmest present subsurface is obtained for an accretion in the Kuiper belt and migration to the present orbit. Conclusions. Our results indicate that Ceres' material could have been aqueously altered on small precursors. The modeled structure of Ceres suggests that a liquid layer could still be present between the crust and the core, which is consistent with Dawn observations and, thus, suggests accretion in the Kuiper belt. While the crust stability calculations indicate crust retention, the convection analysis and interior evolution imply that the crust could still be evolving.},

  abstract = {Context. Many databases on asteroid brightnesses (e.g. ALCDEF, WISE) are potential sources for extensive asteroid shape and spin modelling. Individual lightcurve inversion models require several apparitions and hundreds of data points per target. However, we can analyse the coarse shape and spin distributions over populations of at least thousands of targets even if there are only a few points and one apparition per asteroid. This is done by examining the distribution of the brightness variations observed within the chosen population. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: Brightness variation has been proposed as a population-scale rather than individual-target observable in two studies so far. We aim to examine this approach rigorously to establish its theoretical validity, degree of ill-posedness, and practical applicability. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We model the observed brightness variation of a target population by considering its cumulative distribution function (CDF) caused by the joint distribution function of two fundamental shape and spin indicators. These are the shape elongation and the spin latitude of a simple ellipsoidal model. The main advantage of the model is that we can derive analytical basis functions that yield the observed CDF as a function of the shape and spin distribution. The inverse problem can be treated linearly. Even though the inaccuracy of the model is considerable, databases of thousands of targets should yield some information on the distribution. We employ numerical simulations to establish this and analyse photometric databases that provide sufficiently large numbers of data points for reliable brightness variation estimates. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We establish the theoretical soundness and the typical accuracy limits of the approach both analytically and numerically. We propose a robust brightness variation observable {$\eta$} based on at least five brightness points per target. We also discuss the weaker reliability and information content of the case of only two points per object. Using simulations, we derive a practical estimate of the model distribution in the (shape, spin)-plane. We show that databases such as Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) yield coarse but robust estimates of this distribution, and as an example compare various asteroid families with each other.},

  abstract = {The steady-state population of bodies resulting from a collisional cascade depends on how material strength varies with size. We find a simple expression for the power-law index of the population, given a power law that describes how material strength varies with size. This result is extended to the case relevant for the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt, in which the material strength is described by 2 separate power laws\textemdash one for small bodies and one for larger bodies. We find that the power-law index of the small body population is unaffected by the strength law for the large bodies, and vice versa. Simple analytical expressions describe a wave that is superimposed on the large body population because of the transition between the two power laws describing the strength. These analytical results yield excellent agreement with a numerical simulation of collisional evolution. These results will help to interpret observations of the asteroids and KBOs, and constrain the strength properties of those objects.},

In order to quantitatively address this puzzle, we have performed Monte Carlo simulation of advection/diffusion of silicate particles in a turbulent disk, in the setting based on pebble accretion model: pebbles consisting of many small amorphous silicates embedded in icy mantle are formed in the disk outer region, silicate particles are released at the snow line, crystalline silicate particles are produced at the annealing line, the silicate particles diffused beyond the snow line, and they eventually stick to drifting pebbles to come back to the snow line. In a simple case without the sticking and with a steady pebble flux, we show through the simulations and analytical arguments that crystalline components in silicate materials beyond the snow line is robustly and uniformly \textasciitilde{} 5\%. On the other hand, in a more realistic case with the sticking and with a decaying pebble flux, the crystalline abundance is raised up to \textasciitilde{} 20-25\%, depending on the ratio of decay and diffusion timescales. This abundance is consistent with the observations. In this investigation, we assume a simple steady accretion disk. The simulations coupled with the disk evolution is needed for more detailed comparison with observed data.},

In our survey, 18 comets, including both the Oort cloud comets and the Jupiter-family comets, were observed in the period from 2008 June to 2010 January, most of which were observed at least twice. The prominent emission bands in the observed spectra are the fundamental vibrational bands of water (H2O) at 2.7 {$\mu$}m and carbon dioxide (CO2) at 4.3 {$\mu$}m. The fundamental vibrational band of carbon monoxide (CO) around 4.7 {$\mu$}m and the broad emission feature, probably related to carbon\textendash hydrogen-bearing molecules, can also be recognized around the 3.3\textendash 3.5-{$\mu$}m region in some of the comets. With respect to H2O, gas production rate ratios of CO2 have been derived in 17 comets, except for the comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1. Our data set provides the largest homogeneous database of CO2/H2O production rate ratios in comets obtained so far. The CO2/H2O production rate ratios are considered to reflect the composition of cometary ice when a comet is observed at a heliocentric distance within {$\sim$}2.5 AU, since H2O ice fully sublimates there. The CO2/H2O ratio in cometary ice spans from several to {$\sim$}30\% among the comets observed at {$<$}2.5 AU (13 out of the 17 comets). Alternatively, the ratio of CO/CO2 in the comets seems to be smaller than unity based on our observations, although we only obtain upper limits for CO in most of the comets.},

Production rates and relative ratios between different species reveal how much ice is present and inform models of the conditions in the early solar system. In particular, CUBES will lead to advances in detection of water from very faint comets, revealing how much ice may be hidden in the main asteroid belt, and in measuring isotopic and molecular composition ratios in a much wider range of comets than currently possible, provide constraints on their formation temperatures. CUBES will also be sensitive to emissions from gaseous metals (e.g., FeI and NiI), which have recently been identified in comets and offer an entirely new area of investigation to understand these enigmatic objects.},

The comet made a close approach to Mars on October 19, 2014, and was then observed by many space-borne and ground-based telescopes. We followed the evolution of the OH, NH, CN, C3, and C2 production rates as well as the A f {$\rho$} parameter, a proxy for the dust production. We detected an outburst two weeks after perihelion, with gas and dust production rates increased by a factor of five within a few days. By modelling the shape of the CN and C2 radial profiles, we determined that the outburst happened on November 10 around 15:30 UT ({$\pm$}5 h) and measured a gas expansion velocity of 1.1 {$\pm$} 0.2 km s-1. We used a thermal evolution model to reproduce the activity pattern and outburst. Our results are consistent with the progressive formation of a dust mantle explaining the shallow dependence of gas production rates, which may be partially blown off during the outburst. We studied the evolution of gas composition, using various ratios such as CN/OH, C2/OH, or C3/OH, which showed little or no variation with heliocentric distance, including at the time of the outburst. This indicates a relative level of homogeneity of the nucleus composition.},

We explore the usability of G12 in taxonomic classification for individual objects, asteroid families, and dynamical groups. We conclude that the mean values of G12 for the considered taxonomic complexes are statistically different, and also discuss the overall shape of the G12 distribution for each taxonomic complex. Based on the values of G12 for about half a million asteroids, we compute the probabilities of C, S, and X complex membership for each asteroid. For an individual asteroid, these probabilities are rather evenly distributed over all of the complexes, thus preventing meaningful classification. We then present and discuss the G12 distributions for asteroid families, and predict the taxonomic complex preponderance for asteroid families given the distribution of G12 in each family. For certain asteroid families, the probabilistic prediction of taxonomic complex preponderance can clearly be made. In particular, the C complex preponderant families are the easiest to detect, the Dora and Themis families being prime examples of such families. We continue by presenting the G12-based distribution of taxonomic complexes throughout the main asteroid belt in the proper element phase space. The Nysa-Polana family shows two distinct regions in the proper element space with different G12 values dominating in each region. We conclude that the G12-based probabilistic distribution of taxonomic complexes through the main belt agrees with the general view of C complex asteroid proportion increasing towards the outer belt. We conclude that the G12 photometric parameter cannot be used in determining taxonomic complex for individual asteroids, but it can be utilized in the statistical treatment of asteroid families and different regions of the main asteroid belt.},

We analyzed each image by: i) comparing the major axis orientation of the asteroid's elliptical PSF to its non-sidereal rate on the sky, and ii) comparing the one-dimensional median profile created by collapsing the image along the asteroid's direction of motion to that of nearby field stars. For both methods, we flagged any results that deviated significantly from the expected measurements of single asteroids, and those targets with the most flags were identified as binary candidates for confirmation with high-acuity imaging.},

This data release, named TSSYS-DR1, contains 9912 light curves obtained and extracted in a homogeneous manner, and triples the number of bodies with unambiguous fundamental rotation characteristics, namely where accurate periods and amplitudes are both reported. Our catalog clearly shows that the number of bodies with long rotation periods are definitely underestimated by all previous ground-based surveys, by at least an order of magnitude.},

The method consists in fitting the exponential decay function to the measured coma brightness in the aperture radius range from 0.5 to 2 pixels, and extrapolating this function to 0 pixels to obtain nuclear brightness. The R-band absolute nuclear magnitude RN(1, 1, 0), and the logarithm of the nucleus diameter DN expressed in kilometres, follow a linear dependence with the absolute total visual magnitude H. This dependence is of the form RN(1, 1, 0) = 12.5943 + 0.648H, and log DN[km] = 1.2415 - 0.13H. Comet 2P/Encke does not fit this dependence due to its high nuclear density of 800 kg m-3 (Sosa \& Fern\'andez 2009). The mean bulk density of the observed comets (except 2P/Encke) is 453 {$\pm$} 29 kg m-3. The accuracy of the method in determining the brightness of comet nuclei at a level of 1{$\sigma$} is 8 per cent.},

  abstract = {Kuiper belt objects, such as Arrokoth, the probable progenitors of short-period comets, formed and evolved at large heliocentric distances, where the ambient temperatures appear to be sufficiently low for preserving volatile ices. By detailed numerical simulations, we follow the long-term evolution of small bodies, composed of amorphous water ice, dust, and ices of other volatile species that are commonly observed in comets. The heat sources are solar radiation and the decay of short-lived radionuclides. The bodies are highly porous and gases released in the interior flow through the porous medium. The most volatile ices, CO and CH4, are found to be depleted down to the centre over a time-scale of the order of 100~Myr. Sublimation fronts advance from the surface inward, and when the temperature in the inner part rises sufficiently, bulk sublimation throughout the interior reduces gradually the volatile ices content until they are completely lost. All the other ices survive, which is compatible with data collected by New Horizons on Arrokoth, showing the presence of methanol, and possibly, H2O, CO2, NH3, and C2H6, but no hypervolatiles. The effect of short-lived radionuclides is to increase the sublimation equilibrium temperatures and reduce volatile depletion times. We consider the effect of the bulk density, abundance ratios, and heliocentric distance. At 100 au, CO is depleted, but CH4 survives to present times, except for a thin outer layer. Since, CO is abundantly detected in comets, we conclude that the source of highly volatile species in active comets must be gas trapped in amorphous ice.},

We use analytical arguments and numerical simulations to determine their collisional lifetimes given various impactor size distributions and include the effects of mass loss and multiple impacts over the lifetime of each system. These collisional lifetimes constrain the population of small (R 1 km) objects currently residing in the Kuiper Belt and confirm that the size distribution slope at small size cannot be excessively steep\textemdash likely q 3.5. We track mutual semimajor axis, inclination, and eccentricity evolution through our simulations and show that it is unlikely that the wide binary population represents an evolved tail of the primordially tight binary population. We find that if the wide binaries are a collisionally eroded population, their primordial mutual orbit planes must have preferred to lie in the plane of the solar system. Finally, we find that current limits on the size distribution at small radii remain high enough that the prospect of detecting dust-producing collisions in real time in the Kuiper Belt with future optical surveys is feasible.},

  abstract = {Ever since the very first photometric studies of Centaurs and Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) their visible color distribution has been controversial. This controversy has triggered to a prolific debate on the origin of the surface colors of these distant icy objects of the solar system. Two scenarios have been proposed to interpret and explain the large variability of colors, hence surface composition. Are the colors mainly primordial and directly related to the formation region, or are they the result of surface evolution processes? To date, no mechanism has been found that successfully explains why Centaurs, which are escapees from the Kuiper belt, exhibit two distinct color groups, whereas KBOs do not. We readdress this issue using a carefully compiled set of B - R colors and HR({$\alpha$}) magnitudes (as proxy for size) for 253 objects, including data for 10 new small objects. We find that the bimodal color distribution of Centaurs is a size-related phenomenon, common to both Centaurs and small KBOs, i.e. independent of dynamical classification. Furthermore, we find that large KBOs also have a bimodal distribution of surface colors, albeit distinct from the small objects and strongly dependent on the ``Haumea collisional family'' objects. When plotted in B - R, HR({$\alpha$}) space, the colors of Centaurs and KBOs display a peculiar N shape.},

Some of these objects produce luminous columns when they ablate during the hypersonic encounter with air molecules. A few fireballs occur each year bright enough to be detected from space. The source of these events is still a matter of debate, but it is generally accepted that they are of sporadic origin. We studied the NASA-JPL Center for NEOs Studies (CNEOS) fireball database to infer the dynamic origin of large bolides produced by meter-sized projectiles that impacted our planet. These likely meteorite-dropping events were recorded by the US Government satellite sensors. We estimated the false-positive rate and analyzed the time evolution of multiple orbit dissimilarity criteria concerning potential associations with near-Earth objects and meteoroid streams. We found that at least 16\% of the large bolides could be associated with meteoroid streams, about 4\% are likely associated with near-Earth asteroids, and 4\% may be linked to near-Earth comets. This implies that a significant fraction of meter-sized impactors producing large bolides may have an asteroidal or cometary origin. In addition, we found at least three bolides having hyperbolic orbits with high tensile strength values. Meter-sized meteoroids of interstellar origin could be more common than previously thought, representing about 1\% of the flux of large bolides. The inferred bulk physical properties suggest that the interstellar medium could bias these projectiles towards high strength rocks with the ability to survive prolonged exposure to the harsh interstellar space conditions.},

Based on stellar occultations observed between 2018 and 2021, an inhomogeneous ring (Q1R, i.e., Quaoar's first ring) has been detected around this body.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} A new stellar occultation by Quaoar was observed on August 9, 2022, with the aim of improving Quaoar's shape models and the physical parameters of Q1R, while searching for additional material around the body.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The occultation provided nine effective chords across Quaoar, pinning down its size, shape, and astrometric position. Large facilities, such as Gemini North and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), were used to obtain high acquisition rates and signal-to-noise ratios. The light curves were also used to characterize the Q1R ring (radial profiles and orbital elements).\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Quaoar's elliptical fit to the occultation chords yields the limb with an apparent semi-major axis of 579.5 {$\pm$} 4.0 km, apparent oblateness of 0.12 {$\pm$} 0.01, and area-equivalent radius of 543 {$\pm$} 2 km. Quaoar's limb orientation is consistent with Q1R and Weywot orbiting in Quaoar's equatorial plane. The orbital radius of Q1R is refined to a value of 4057 {$\pm$} 6 km. The radial opacity profile of the more opaque ring profile follows a Lorentzian shape that extends over 60 km, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of {$\sim$}5 km and a peak normal optical depth of 0.4. Besides the secondary events related to the already reported rings, new secondary events detected during the August 2022 occultation in three different data sets are consistent with another ring around Quaoar with a radius of 2520 {$\pm$} 20 km, assuming the ring is circular and co-planar with Q1R. This new ring has a typical width of 10 km and a normal optical depth of {$\sim$}0.004. Just as Q1R, it also lies outside Quaoar's classical Roche limit.}}}}},

From 2021 November 18 to 20, citizen astronomers located in nine different countries gathered 43 observations, covering the 16 hour long transit.

  abstract = {Most asteroids with a diameter larger than \$\textbackslash sim 300 \textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash rm m\}\$ are rubble piles i.e. consisting of more than one solid object. All asteroids are rotating but almost all asteroids larger than \$\textbackslash sim 300 \textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash rm m\}\$ rotate with a period longer than \$2.3 \textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash rm hours\}\$, which is the critical period where the centrifugal force equals the gravitational force. This indicates that there are nearly no adhesive interaction forces between the asteroid fragments. We show that this is due to the surface roughness of the asteroid particles which reduces the van der Waals interaction between the particles by a factor of \$100\$ for micrometer sized particles and even more for larger particles. We show that surface roughness results in an interaction force which is independent of the size of the particles, in contrast to the linear size dependency expected for particles with smooth surfaces. Thus, two stone fragments of size \$100 \textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash rm nm\}\$ attract each other with the same non-gravitational force as two fragments of size \$10 \textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash rm m\}\$.},

  abstract = {Context. During the post-perihelion phase of the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission to comet 67P, the Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System on board the spacecraft took numerous image sequences of the near-nucleus coma, with many showing the motion of individual pieces of debris ejected from active surface areas into space. Aims. We aim to track the motion of individual particles in these image sequences and derive their projected velocities and accelerations. This should help us to constrain their point of origin on the surface, understand the forces that influence their dynamics in the inner coma, and predict whether they will fall back to the surface or escape to interplanetary space. Methods. We have developed an algorithm that tracks the motion of particles appearing as point sources in image sequences. Our algorithm employs a point source detection software to locate the particles and then exploits the image sequences' pair-nature to reconstruct the particle tracks and derive the projected velocities and accelerations. We also constrained the particle size from their brightness. Results. Our algorithm identified 2268 tracks in a sample image sequence. Manual inspection not only found that 1187 (\textasciitilde 52\%) of them are likely genuine, but in combination with runs on simulated data it also revealed a simple criterion related to the completeness of a track to single out a large subset of the genuine tracks without the need for manual intervention. A tentative analysis of a small (n = 89) group of particles exemplifies how our data can be used, and provides first results on the particles' velocity, acceleration, and radius distributions, which agree with previous work.},

The new update also includes a list of known asteroid rotational periods and a CD-ROM containing all the existing digital data in the APC. The total number of observed lightcurves is growing rapidly, not the least because of the new state-of-the-art equipment and growing interest among amateur astronomers. The photometric database is now so large that the present format must be altered to facilitate a user-friendly on-line service for the down- and uploading of data. We are proposing (and have started to construct) a new Internet-based Standard Asteroid Photometric Catalogue (SAPC). The website is planned to open during the first half of the year 2002. In addition to the data files, the site would contain the index and guide to the catalogue, a web-form for reporting observations, and some general observing guidelines (e.g., on filters, timing, etc.). There would also be a list of asteroids for which more observations are needed, together with recommended observing periods. This would be accompanied by an up-to-date collection of physical asteroid models based on photometric data, as well as links to observer network pages and other sites that work in collaboration with the catalogue project. Our aim is to develop this site into a global standard service used by everyone involved in asteroid photometry.},

  abstract = {The distribution of surface classes of resonant trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) provides constraints on the proto-planetesimal disk and giant planet migration. To better understand the surfaces of TNOs, the Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (Col-OSSOS) acquired multi-band photometry of 92 TNOs, and found that the surfaces of TNOs can be well described by two surface classifications, BrightIR and FaintIR. These classifications both include optically red members and are differentiated predominantly based on whether their near-infrared spectral slope is similar to their optical spectral slope. The vast majority of cold classical TNOs, with dynamically unexcited orbits, have the FaintIR surface classification, and we infer that TNOs in other dynamical classifications with FaintIR surfaces share a common origin with the cold classical TNOs. Comparison between the resonant populations and the possible parent populations of cold classical and dynamically excited TNOs reveal that the 3:2 has minimal contributions from the FaintIR class, consistent with the \$\textbackslash nu\_8\$ secular resonance clearing the region near the 3:2 before any sweeping capture occurred. Conversely, the FaintIR class is over-represented in the 4:3 resonance, 2:1 resonance, and the resonances within the cold classical belt, implying that the FaintIR surface formed in the protoplanetary disk between \textasciitilde{$<$}34.6 au to \textasciitilde{$>$}47 au, though the outer bound depends on the degree of resonance sweeping during migration. The presence and absence of the FaintIR surfaces in Neptune's resonances provides critical constraints for the history of Neptune's migration, the evolution of the \$\textbackslash nu\_8\$, and the surface class distribution in the initial planetesimal disk.},

  abstract = {Inward migration of giant planets is predicted by hydrodynamical simulations during the gas phase of the protoplanetary disc. The phenomenon is also invoked to explain resonant and near-resonant exoplanetary system structures. The early inward migration may also have affected our Solar System and sculpted its different minor planet reservoirs. In this study we explore how the early inward migration of the giant planets shapes the Kuiper Belt. We test different scenarios with only Neptune and Uranus and with all the four giant planets, including also some models with the subsequent outward planetesimal-driven migration of Neptune after the gas dispersal. We find objects populating mean motion resonances even when Neptune and Uranus do not migrate at all or only migrate inwards. When the planets are fixed, planetesimals stick only temporarily to the mean motion resonances, while inwards migration yields a new channel to populate the resonances without invoking convergent migration. In these cases, however, it is hard to populate mean motion resonances that do not cross the planetesimal disc (such as 2:1 and 5:2) and there is a lack of resonant KBOs that cross Neptune's orbit. These Neptune crossers are an unambiguous signature of the outward migration of Neptune. The starting position and the growth rate of Neptune matters for the contamination of the classical Kuiper belt region from neighbouring regions. The eccentricity and inclination space of the hot classicals and the scattered disc region become much more populated when all the giant planets are included. The 5:2 resonance with Neptune becomes increasingly populated with deeper inward migrations of Neptune. The overall inclination distribution, however, is still narrower than from observations, as is generally the case for Kuiper belt population models.},

  abstract = {Manx objects approach the inner solar system on long-period comet (LPC) orbits with the consequent high inbound velocities, but unlike comets, Manxes display very little to no activity even near perihelion. This suggests that they may have formed in circumstances different from typical LPCs; moreover, this lack of significant activity also renders them difficult to detect at large distances. Thus, analyzing their physical properties can help constrain models of solar system formation as well as sharpen detection methods for those classified as NEOs. Here, we focus on the Manx candidate A/2018 V3 as part of a larger effort to characterize Manxes as a whole. This particular object was observed to be inactive even at its perihelion at q = 1.34 au in 2019 September. Its spectral reflectivity is consistent with typical organic-rich comet surfaces with colors of g\textcent{} - r\textcent{} = 0.67  0.02, r\textcent{} - i\textcent{} = 0.26  0.02, and r\textcent{} - z\textcent{} = 0.45  0.02, corresponding to a spectral reflectivity slope of 10.6 {$\pm$} 0.9\%/ 100 nm. A least-squares fit of our constructed light curve to the observational data yields an average nucleus radius of {$\approx$}2 km assuming an albedo of 0.04. This is consistent with the value measured from NEOWISE. A surface brightness analysis for data taken 2020 July 13 indicated possible low activity (0.68 g s-1), but not enough to lift optically significant amounts of dust. Finally, we discuss Manxes as a constraint on solar system dynamical models as well as their implications for planetary defense.},

The main part of the belt objects is located in the annular zone between 39.4 and 47.8 au from the Sun; the boundaries correspond to the average distances for orbital resonances 3:2 and 2:1 with the motion of Neptune. One-dimensional, two-dimensional, and discrete rings to model the total gravitational attraction of numerous belt objects are considered. The discrete rotating model most correctly reflects the real interaction of bodies in the Solar system. The masses of the model rings were determined within EPM2017\textemdash the new version of ephemerides of planets and the Moon at IAA RAS\textemdash by fitting spacecraft ranging observations. The total mass of the Kuiper belt was calculated as the sum of the masses of the 31 largest trans-Neptunian objects directly included in the simultaneous integration and the estimated mass of the model of the discrete ring of TNO. The total mass is (1.97 {$\pm$} 0.35) \texttimes{} 10-2 m{$\oplus$}. The gravitational influence of the Kuiper belt on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune exceeds at times the attraction of the hypothetical 9th planet with a mass of {$\sim$} 10 m{$\oplus$} at the distances assumed for it.

  abstract = {A circumsolar dust ring has been recently discovered close to the orbit of Mercury. There are currently no hypotheses for the origin of this ring in the literature, so we explore four different origin scenarios here: the dust originated from (1) the sporadic meteoroid complex that comprises the major portion of the Zodiacal Cloud, (2) recent asteroidal/cometary activity, (3) hypothetical dust-generating bodies locked in mean-motion resonances beyond Mercury, and (4) bodies co-orbiting with Mercury. We find that only scenario (4) reproduces the observed structure and location of Mercury's dust ring. However, the lifetimes of Mercury's co-orbitals ({$<$}20 Ma) preclude a primordial origin of the co-orbiting source population due to dynamical instabilities and meteoroid bombardment, demanding a recent event feeding the observed dust ring. We find that an impact on Mercury can eject debris into the co-orbital resonance. We estimate the ages of six candidate impacts that formed craters larger than 40 km in diameter using high-resolution spacecraft data from MESSENGER and find two craters with estimated surface ages younger than 50 Ma. We find that the amount of mass transported from Mercury's surface into the co-orbital resonance from these two impacts is several orders of magnitude smaller than what is needed to explain the magnitude of Mercury's ring inferred from remote sensing. Therefore we suggest that numerous younger, smaller impacts collectively contributed to the origin of the ring. We conclude that the recent impact hypothesis for the origin of Mercury's dust ring is a viable scenario, whose validity can be constrained by future inner solar system missions.},

Here, we follow the paradigm that turbulence created overdense pebble clouds, which then collapse under their own self-gravity. We use the multiphysics code GIZMO to model the pebble cloud density as a continuum, with a polytropic equation of state to account for collisional interactions and capturing the phase transition to a quasi-incompressible ``solid'' object, i.e., a planetesimal in hydrostatic equilibrium. Thus, we study cloud collapse effectively at the resolution of the forming planetesimals, allowing us to derive an initial mass function for planetesimals in relation to the total pebble mass of the collapsing cloud. The redistribution of angular momentum in the collapsing pebble cloud is the main mechanism leading to multiple fragmentation. The angular momentum of the pebble cloud and thus the centrifugal radius increases with distance to the Sun, but the solid size of the forming planetesimals is constant. Therefore we find that with increasing distance to the Sun, the number of forming planetesimals per pebble cloud increases. For all distances, the formation of binaries occurs within higher hierarchical systems. The size distribution is top-heavy and can be described with a Gaussian distribution of planetesimal mass. For the asteroid belt, we can infer a most likely size of 125 km, all stemming from pebble clouds of equivalent size 152 km.},

  abstract = {Here we report the comparison between unresolved reflectance spectroscopy of Solar System small bodies and laboratory measurements on reference surfaces. We measure the bidirectional reflectance spectroscopy of a powder of howardite and a sublimation residue composed of a Ceres analogue. The spectra are then inverted using the Hapke semi-empirical physical model and the MRTLS parametric model to be able to simulate the reflectance of the surfaces under any geometrical configuration needed. We note that both models enable an accurate rendering of the reflectance spectroscopy, but the MRTLS model adds less noise on the spectra compared to the Hapke model. Using the parameters resulting from the inversions, we simulate two spherical bodies and the small bodies (1)Ceres and (4)Vesta whose surfaces are homogeneously covered with the Ceres analogue and powder of howardite respectively. We then simulate various scenarios of illumination and spectroscopic observations, i.e. spot-pointing and fly-bys, of these small bodies for phases angles between 6\textdegree{} and 135\textdegree. The unresolved reflectance spectroscopy of the simulated bodies is retrieved from the resulting images, and compared to the reflectance spectroscopy of the reference surface measured in the laboratory. Our results show that the photometric phase curves of the simulated bodies are different from the reference surfaces because of the variations of the local incidence and emergence angles due to the shape and topography of the surface. At low phase angle, the simulated bodies are brighter than the reference surfaces, with lower spectral slope and shallower absorption bands. We observe the maximum differences at wide phase angles with the various simulated observations of (4)Vesta due to its high surface topography. Finally, we highlight the differences in the spectral parameters derived from the unresolved observations at 30\textdegree{} with laboratory measurements acquired under a single geometrical configuration.},

  abstract = {We obtained estimates of the Johnson V absolute magnitudes (H) and slope parameters (G) for 583 mainbelt and near-Earth asteroids observed at Ondr\textasciicaron ejov and Table Mountain Observatory from 1978 to 2011. Uncertainties of the absolute magnitudes in our sample are {$<$}0.21 mag, with a median value of 0.10 mag. We compared the H data with absolute magnitude values given in the MPCORB, Pisa AstDyS and JPL Horizons orbit catalogs. We found that while the catalog absolute magnitudes for large asteroids are relatively good on average, showing only little biases smaller than 0.1 mag, there is a systematic offset of the catalog values for smaller asteroids that becomes prominent in a range of H greater than \$10 and is particularly big above H \$ 12. The mean (Hcatalog \`A H) value is negative, i.e., the catalog H values are systematically too bright. This systematic negative offset of the catalog values reaches a maximum around H = 14 where the mean (Hcatalog \`A H) is \`A0.4 to \`A0.5. We found also smaller correlations of the offset of the catalog H values with taxonomic types and with lightcurve amplitude, up to \$0.1 mag or less. We discuss a few possible observational causes for the observed correlations, but the reason for the large bias of the catalog absolute magnitudes peaking around H = 14 is unknown; we suspect that the problem lies in the magnitude estimates reported by asteroid surveys. With our photometric H and G data, we revised the preliminary WISE albedo estimates made by Masiero et al. (Masired, J.R. et al. [2011]. Astrophys. J. 741, 68\textendash 89) and Mainzer et al. (Mainzer, A. et al. [2011b]. Astrophys. J. 743, 156\textendash 172) for asteroids in our sample. We found that the mean geometric albedo of Tholen/Bus/DeMeo C/G/B/F/P/D types with sizes of 25\textendash 300 km is pV = 0.057 with the standard deviation (dispersion) of the sample of 0.013 and the mean albedo of S/A/L types with sizes 0.6\textendash 200 km is 0.197 with the standard deviation of the sample of 0.051. The standard errors of the mean albedos are 0.002 and 0.006, respectively; systematic observational or modeling errors can predominate over the quoted formal errors. There is apparent only a small, marginally significant difference of 0.031 {$\pm$} 0.011 between the mean albedos of sub-samples of large and small (divided at diameter 25 km) S/A/L asteroids, with the smaller ones having a higher albedo. The difference will have to be confirmed and explained; we speculate that it may be either a real size dependence of surface properties of S type asteroids or a small size-dependent bias in the data (e.g., a bias towards higher albedos in the optically-selected sample of asteroids). A trend of the mean of the preliminary WISE albedo estimates increasing with asteroid size decreasing from D \$ 30 down to \$5 km (for S types) showed in Mainzer et al. (Mainzer, A. et al. [2011a]. Astrophys. J. 741, 90\textendash 114) appears to be mainly due to the systematic bias in the MPCORB absolute magnitudes that progressively increases with H in the corresponding range H = 10\textendash 14.},

Small asteroids (0.15 {$<$} D {$<$} 10 km) show significant excesses of both slow and fast rotations, a "barrier" against spins faster than \textasciitilde 12 rotations per day, and some of them are binary systems on inner-planet-crossing orbits with a characteristic fast rotation of their primaries. These small asteroids are collisionally derived fragments, mostly with negligible tensile strength (rubble-pile or shattered interior structure). They mostly gained angular momentum through collisions, but noncollisional factors have also affected their spins and perhaps shapes. In the intermediate size range (10 {$<$} D {$<$} 40 km), the populations of large and small asteroids overlap. Most tiny asteroids smaller than D ? 0.15 km are rotating so fast that they cannot be held together by self-gravitation and therefore must be coherent bodies. They likely are single fragments of the rubble that make up larger asteroids from which the smaller ones are derived.},

The most abundant binary population is that of close binary systems among near-Earth, Mars-crossing, and main belt asteroids that have a primary diameter of about 10 km or smaller. They have a total angular momentum very close to, but not generally exceeding, the critical limit for a single body in a gravity regime. This suggests that they formed from parent bodies spinning at the critical rate (at the gravity spin limit for asteroids in the size range) by some sort of fission or mass shedding. The Yarkovsky\textendash O'Keefe\textendash Radzievskii\textendash Paddack (YORP) effect is a candidate to be the dominant source of spin-up to instability. Gravitational interactions during close approaches to the terrestrial planets cannot be a primary mechanism of formation of the binaries, but it may affect properties of the NEA part of the binary population.},

The observed distribution appears to be controlled by the Yarkovsky\textendash O'Keefe\textendash Radzievskii\textendash Paddack (YORP) effect. The magnitude of the excess of slow rotators is related to the residence time of slowed down asteroids in the excess and the rate of spin rate change outside the excess.

The spin rate distribution of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) with sizes in the range 0.2\textendash 3 km ({$\sim$}5 times smaller in median diameter than the MB/MC asteroids sample) shows a similar excess of slow rotators, but there is also a concentration of NEAs at fast spin rates with f = 9\textendash 10 d-1. The concentration at fast spin rates is correlated with a narrower distribution of spin rates of primaries of binary systems among NEAs; the difference may be due to the apparently more evolved population of binaries among MB/MC asteroids.},

It is therefore the expected form of ice in comets and other primitive bodies that have escaped substantial heating since formation. Despite expectations, however, the observational evidence for amorphous ice in comets remains largely indirect. This is both because the spectral features of amorphous ice are subtle and because the solar system objects for which we possess high quality data are mostly too close to the Sun and too hot for amorphous ice to survive near the surface, where it can be detected. This chapter reviews the properties of amorphous ice, the evidence for its existence and its consequences for the behavior of comets.},

However, the icy debris beyond the orbit of Neptune, called the Kuiper Belt, contains only one known family, the Haumea family. So far, no self-consistent explanation for the formation of the Haumea family can match all geophysical and orbital characteristics of the family without invoking extremely improbable events. Here, we show that the family is adequately explained as the product of a merging binary near the end of Neptune's orbital migration. The unique orbital signature of a merging binary, which was not found in extensive searches, is effectively erased during the final stages of migration, providing an explanation for all aspects of the Haumea family. By placing the formation of the Haumea family in the broader context of solar system formation, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept model for the formation of Haumea.},

There are about 800,000 asteroids and 2,000 comets included in the SSOSS, available through ESASky, providing both targeted and serendipitous observations. For this first release, three missions were chosen: XMM-Newton, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and Herschel. Results. We present a catalog listing all potential detections of asteroids within estimated limiting magnitude or flux limit in Herschel, XMM-Newton, and HST archival imaging data, including 909 serendipitous detections in Herschel images, 985 in XMM-Newton Optical Monitor camera images, and over 32,000 potential serendipitous detections in HST images. We also present a case study: the analysis of the thermal properties of Psyche from four serendipitous Herschel detections, combined with previously published thermal IR measurements. We see strong evidence for an unusual drop in (hemispherical spectral) emissivity, from 0.9 at 100 \textmu m down to about 0.6 at 350 \textmu m, followed by a possible but not well-constrained increase towards 500 \textmu m, comparable to what was found for Vesta. The combined thermal data set puts a strong constraint on Psyche's thermal inertia (between 20 to 80 J m-2 s-1/2 K-1) and favors an intermediate to low level surface roughness (below 0.4 for the rms of surface slopes). Conclusions. Using the example of Psyche, we show how the SSOSS provides fast access to observations of SSOs from the ESA astronomical archives, regardless of whether the particular object was the actual target. This greatly simplifies the task of searching, identifying, and retrieving such data for scientific analysis.},

Similar structures are expected for the secondaries of small asteroid binaries, including Dimorphos, the smaller component of the 65803 Didymos binary system and the target of NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) and ESA's Hera mission. The DART impact occurs on September 26th, 2022 and it will alter the orbital period of Dimorphos around Didymos. Aims. In this work we assume Dimorphos-like bodies with a rubble-pile structure, and quantify the effects of boulder packing in its interior on the post-impact morphology, degree of shape change and material ejection processes. Methods. We used the Bern SPH shock physics code to numerically model hypervelocity impacts into small, 160 m in diameter rubble-pile asteroids, with a variety of boulder distributions. Results. We find that the post-impact target morphology is most sensitive to the mass-fraction of boulders in the target, while the asteroid deflection efficiency depends on both the mass-fraction of boulders in the target and on the boulder size-distribution close to the impact point. Our results may also have important implications for the structure of small asteroids.},

UBV and (RI)C data for 46 and 76 of these stars, respectively, are published for the first time. Combining our data with those from the literature, colors in the UBV(RI)C system, with 0.01 mag precision, are now available for 112 solar analogs. Multiple linear regression is used to derive the solar colors from these photometric data and the spectroscopically derived Teff, log g, and [Fe/H] values. To minimize the impact of systematic errors in the model-dependent atmospheric parameters, we use only the data for the 10 stars that most closely resemble our Sun, i.e., the solar twins, and derive the following solar colors: (B - V ) = 0.653 {$\pm$} 0.005, (U - B) = 0.166 {$\pm$} 0.022, (V - R) = 0.352 {$\pm$} 0.007, and (V - I ) = 0.702 {$\pm$} 0.010.

We report ultraviolet observations with the Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) spectrometer aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory satellite at five heights as the comet approached the Sun. The brightest line, Ly{$\alpha$}, shows dramatic variations in intensity, velocity centroid, and width during the observation at each height. We derive the outgassing rates and the abundances of N, O, and Si relative to H, and we estimate the effective diameter of the nucleus to be several hundred meters. We consider the effects of the large outgassing rate on the interaction between the cometary gas and the solar corona and find good qualitative agreement with the picture of a bow shock resulting from mass loading by cometary neutrals. We obtain estimates of the solar wind density, temperature, and speed, and compare them with predictions of a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation, finding qualitative agreement within our uncertainties. We also determine the sublimation rate of silicate dust in the comet's tail by comparing the visible brightness from the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraphs with the Si III intensity from UVCS. The sublimation rates lie between the predicted rates for olivines and pyroxenes, suggesting that the grains are composed of a mixture of those minerals.},

  abstract = {We surveyed 23 comets using the Infrared Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope in wide filters centered at 3.6 and 4.5 lm. Emission in the 3.6 lm filter arises from sunlight scattered by dust grains; the 3.6 lm images generally have a coma near the nucleus and a tail in the antisolar direction due to dust grains swept back by solar radiation pressure. The 4.5 lm filter contains scattered sunlight by, and thermal emission from, the same dust grains, as well as strong emission lines from CO2 and CO gas. The 4.5 lm images are often much brighter than could be explained by dust grains, and they show sometimes distinct morphologies, in which cases we infer they are dominated by gas. Based on the ratio of 4.5\textendash 3.6 lm brightness, we classify the survey comets as CO2 + CO `rich' and `poor'. This classification is correlated with previous classifications by A'Hearn based on carbon-chain molecule abundance, in the sense that comets classified as `depleted' in carbon-chain molecules are also `poor' in CO2 + CO. The gas emission in the IRAC 4.5 lm images is characterized by a smooth morphology, typically a fan in the sunward hemisphere with a radial profile that varies approximately as the inverse of projected distance from the nucleus, as would apply for constant production and free expansion. There are very significant radial and azimuthal enhancements in many of the comets, and these are often distinct between the gas and dust, indicating that ejection of solid material may be driven either by H2O or CO2. Notable features in the images include the following. There is a prominent loop of gas emission from 103P/Hartley 2, offset toward the sunward direction; the loop could be due to an outburst of CO2 before the Spitzer image. Prominent, double jets are present in the image of 88P/Howell, with one directed nearly toward the Sun and the other closer to the terminator (but still on the daytime hemisphere). A prominent single jet is evident for C/2002 T7 (LINEAR), 22P/Kopff and 81P/Wild 2. Spirals are apparent in 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 and C/2006 W3 (Christensen); we measure a rotation rate of 21 h for the latter comet. Arcs (possibly parts of a spiral) are apparent in the images of 10P/Tempel 2, and 2P/Encke.},

  abstract = {We present a unique implementation of Python coding in an asynchronous object-oriented programming (OOP) framework to fully automate the process of collecting data with the George Mason University (GMU) Observatory's 0.8-meter telescope. The goal of this project is to perform automated follow-up observations for the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, while still allowing for human control, monitoring, and adjustments. Prior to our implementation, the facility was computer-controlled by a human observer through a combination of webcams, TheSkyX, ASCOM Dome, MaxIm DL, and a weather station. We have automated slews and dome movements, CCD exposures, saving FITS images and metadata, initial focusing, guiding on the target, using the ambient temperature to adjust the focus as the telescope cools through the rest of the night, taking calibration images (darks and flats), and monitoring local weather data. The automated weather monitor periodically checks various weather data from multiple sources to automate the decision to close the observatory during adverse conditions. We have organized the OOP code structure in such a way that each hardware device or important higher-level process is categorized as its own object class or "module" with associated attributes and methods, with inherited common methods across modules for code reusability. To allow actions to be performed simultaneously across different modules, we implemented a multithreaded approach where each module is given its own CPU thread on which to operate concurrently with all other threads. After the initial few modules (camera, telescope, dome, data I/O) were developed, further development of the code was carried out in tandem with testing on sky on clear nights. The code, in its current state, has been tested and used for observations on 171 nights, with more planned usage and feature additions.},

The Wisdom\textendash Holman (WH) integrator in particular has been used extensively in planetary dynamics as it allows for large time-steps at good accuracy. One can extend the WH method to achieve even higher accuracy using several different approaches. In this paper, we survey integrators developed by Wisdom et al., Laskar \& Robutel, and Blanes et al. Since some of these methods are harder to implement and not as readily available to astronomers compared to the standard WH method, they are not used as often. This is somewhat unfortunate given that in typical simulations it is possible to improve the accuracy by up to six orders of magnitude (!) compared to the standard WH method without the need for any additional force evaluations. To change this, we implement a variety of high-order symplectic methods in the freely available N-body integrator REBOUND. In this paper, we catalogue these methods, discuss their differences, describe their error scalings, and benchmark their speed using our implementations.},

This test of kinetic impactor technology will provide the first estimate of the momentum transfer enhancement factor \$\textbackslash beta\$ at a realistic scale, wherein ejecta from the impact provides an additional deflection to the target. Earth-based observations, the LICIACube spacecraft (to be detached from DART prior to impact), and ESA's follow-up Hera mission to launch in 2024, will provide additional characterization of the deflection test. Together Hera and DART comprise the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment (AIDA) cooperation between NASA and ESA. Here the predicted dynamical states of the binary system upon arrival and after impact are presented. The assumed dynamically relaxed state of the system will be excited by the impact, leading to an increase in eccentricity and slight tilt of the orbit together with enhanced libration of Dimorphos with amplitude dependent on the currently poorly known target shape. Free rotation around the moon's long axis may also be triggered and the orbital period will experience variations from seconds to minutes over timescales of days to months. Shape change of either body due to cratering or mass wasting triggered by crater formation and ejecta may affect \$\textbackslash beta\$ but can be constrained through additional measurements. Both BYORP and gravity tides may cause measurable orbital changes on the timescale of Hera's rendezvous.},

Both groups are present in most low-albedo asteroid taxonomic classes, and except in limited cases taxonomic classifications based on 0.5-2.5-\$\textbackslash mu\$m data alone cannot predict whether an asteroid is ST or NST. Statistical tests show the STs and NSTs differ in average band depth, semi-major axis, and perihelion at confidence levels \$\textbackslash ge\$98\textbackslash\%, while not showing significant differences in albedo. We also show that many NSTs have a 3-\$\textbackslash mu\$m absorption band shape like Comet 67P, and likely represent an important small-body composition throughout the solar system. A simple explanation for the origin of these groups is formation on opposite sides of the ammonia snow line, with the NST group accreting H2O and NH3 and the ST group only accreting H2O, with subsequent thermal and chemical evolution resulting in the minerals seen today. Such an explanation is consistent with recent dynamical modeling of planetesimal formation and delivery, and suggests that much more outer solar system material was delivered to the main asteroid belt than would be thought based on the number of D-class asteroids found today.},

This phrase is well-suited to humanity's first crewed mission to Mars, which will likely be the most difficult and technologically challenging human endeavor ever undertaken. The high cost and significant time delay associated with delivering payloads to the Martian surface means that exploitation of resources in situ \textemdash{} including inorganic rock and dust (regolith), water deposits, and atmospheric gases \textemdash{} will be an important part of any crewed mission to the Red Planet. Yet there is one significant, but chronically overlooked, source of natural resources that will \textemdash{} by definition \textemdash{} also be available on any crewed mission to Mars: the crew themselves. In this work, we explore the use of human serum albumin (HSA) \textemdash{} a common protein obtained from blood plasma \textemdash{} as a binder for simulated Lunar and Martian regolith to produce so-called `extraterrestrial regolith biocomposites (ERBs).' In essence, HSA produced by astronauts in vivo could be extracted on a semi-continuous basis and combined with Lunar or Martian regolith to `get stone from blood', to rephrase the proverb. Employing a simple fabrication strategy, HSA-based ERBs were produced and displayed compressive strengths as high as 25.0 MPa. For comparison, standard concrete typically has a compressive strength ranging between 20 and 32 MPa. The incorporation of urea \textemdash{} which could be extracted from the urine, sweat, or tears of astronauts \textemdash{} could further increase the compressive strength by over 300\% in some instances, with the best-performing formulation having an average compressive strength of 39.7 MPa. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HSA-ERBs have the potential to be 3D-printed, opening up an interesting potential avenue for extraterrestrial construction using human-derived feedstocks. The mechanism of adhesion was investigated and attributed to the dehydration-induced reorganization of the protein secondary structure into a densely hydrogenbonded, supramolecular {$\beta$}-sheet network \textemdash{} analogous to the cohesion mechanism of spider silk. For comparison, synthetic spider silk and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were also investigated as regolith binders \textemdash{} which could also feasibly be produced on a Martian colony with future advancements in biomanufacturing technology.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThe Asteroid Terrestrial Last-impact Alert System (ATLAS) currently consists of two robotic telescopes in Hawaii. Together they scan the entire visible night sky every two nights in wideband orange and cyan filters down to \textasciitilde 19.5 mag. In addition to rapid discovery and follow up of Near-Earth Objects, ATLAS serendipitously observes a large number of asteroids and other moving objects. Since operations began in 2015 ATLAS has collected a substantial photometric database of \textasciitilde 7x107 observations for \textasciitilde 430,000 asteroids.Asteroids are valuable compositional and dynamical tracers that can be used to constrain the processes of Solar System evolution. The observed size distribution of an asteroid population can inform us of its primordial formation and subsequent collisional evolution. Composition of a population can indicate a common origin; such as a protoplanetary disk formation region or a relation through asteroid collisional families. We aim to utilise the ATLAS database to investigate the physical properties of a large number of asteroids, by fitting phase curve models to the photometric observations.The form of the phase curve depends on the physical properties of the asteroid and is parameterised by a variety of models which are each described by absolute magnitude and slope parameters. Absolute magnitude, H, is related to the size and albedo of the body. The form of the phase curve is determined by the slope parameter in the phase function and depends on the surface composition and structure. Hence these parameters may be used as proxies for the properties of asteroids when more detailed information is unavailable.METHODSAn analysis of an earlier dataset has been performed using MCMC techniques by Mahlke et al. (2021), providing phase curves in the H, G1, G2 and H, G12* systems (Muinonen et al. 2010, Penttil\"a et al. 2016). In this work we fit both these systems plus the original H, G system (Bowell et al., 1989) to all asteroids in the ATLAS dataset, using Levenberg-Marquardt least squares fitting. We perform a separate fit in both the o and c ATLAS filters. We have investigated various methods of outlier rejection, and use techniques such as initial data cuts, iterative sigma clipping, and avoidance of low galactic latitudes. These have considerably improved the quality of the dataset. However, in some cases the photometric observations may not be well described by the phase curve model due to physical phenomena such as large amplitude rotational variation, or changing aspect angle for asteroids with high spin obliquities.We have created a dataset of phase curve parameters for \textasciitilde 370,000 asteroids, and identify a subset of high quality phase curves where the phase curve model describes the data well and absolute magnitude and slope have low formal uncertainties. We analyse in detail the distribution of these phase curve parameters and verify them with comparison to previous work and catalogue values.RESULTSIn general we find good agreement between our phase curve results and previously published studies, especially for well observed bright asteroids. We identify metrics that indicate the ability to obtain a good fit to the phase function, such as number of observations and phase angle coverage. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scientific value of our database by comparing the properties of the leading and trailing Jupiter Trojans observed with ATLAS.The ability to determine phase curves for large numbers of asteroids, and studying the statistics of their properties, highlights the potential value of sparse photometric survey data for asteroid science. This is especially relevant to the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) which will perform photometry of asteroids at a similar cadence to ATLAS. FIGURESFigure 1.

A large fraction of transneptunian objects are found in binary pairs, \textasciitilde 30\% in the cold classical population between a\textsubscript{hel} \textasciitilde{} 39 and \textasciitilde 48 AU. Observationally, these binaries generally have components of similar size and colour. Previous work has shown that gravitational collapse of a pebble cloud is an efficient mechanism for producing such systems. Since the bi-lobate nature of 2014 MU\textsubscript{69} (Arrokoth) was discovered, interest in gravitational collapse as a pathway for forming contact binaries has also grown. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We investigate the formation of binary systems through gravitational collapse by considering a wider range of binary masses than previous studies. We analysed in detail the properties of the bound systems that are formed and compared them to observations. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We performed N-body simulations of gravitational collapse of a pebble cloud using the REBOUND package, with an integrator designed for rotating reference frames and robust collision detection. We conducted a deep search for gravitationally bound particles at the end of the gravitational collapse phase and tested their stability. For all systems produced, not just for the most massive binaries, we investigated the population characteristics of their mass and orbital parameters. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We found that gravitational collapse is an efficient producer of bound planetesimal systems. On average, about 1.5 bound systems were produced per cloud in the mass range studied here. In addition to large equal-sized binaries, we found that gravitational collapse produces massive bodies with small satellites and low-mass binaries with a high mass ratio. Our results disfavour the collapse of high-mass clouds, in line with reported upper mass limits of clouds formed by the streaming instability. Gravitational collapse can create binary systems analogous to Arrokoth, and collisions in a collapsing cloud should be gentle enough to preserve a bi-lobed structure.},

The units at Haleakala and Mauna Loa have been operating since 2015 and 2017 respectively and together they can scan the visible night sky every two nights down to a limiting magnitude of \textasciitilde 19.5 mag in wideband orange and cyan filters. We have matched the ephemerides of \textasciitilde 445,000 asteroids to ATLAS pointings from these two units up to January 2022, providing us with a photometric database of 9.6\texttimes 107 detections. We can investigate the surface scattering properties of asteroids by observing the change in brightness as a function of the observer-asteroid-Sun phase angle. A well determined phase curve is required to obtain an accurate absolute magnitude for an asteroid, and hence its size if albedo is known. The form of the phase curve depends on the scattering properties of the surface, primarily its composition and roughness, and is described by one or more slope parameters. These slope parameters can be used as a proxy for taxonomic information when more detailed measurements such as spectra are unavailable (e.g. Mahlke et al., 2021). Methods We have analysed the phase curves of all asteroids in our dataset of selected ATLAS photometry, considering o and c filter data separately. We fit a variety of phase curve models to the data using Levenberg-Marquadt least squares fitting but we focused on the results for the HG (Bowell et al., 1989) and HG12* (Penttil\"a et al., 2016) phase curve models specifically. We found that outlying photometric detections were present in the dataset due to brightness contamination from nearby stars/galaxies or incorrect matching of ephemerides. Such data points were dealt with by initial cuts and an iterative sigma clip during fitting. For simplicity we did not account for rotational brightness variation in the phase curve model as for most asteroids this is not accurately constrained. Rotation effects manifest as an additional variation in brightness which leads to greater uncertainty in determining phase curve parameters. However, we show in our results that the fitted phase curve parameters of an ensemble of objects with sufficient phase angle coverage are still useful for science on a population statistics level. Furthermore, we automatically identify asteroids in the dataset that show a significant apparition effect. The phase curves of these objects display shifts in absolute brightness between different apparitions, caused by changes in the asteroid aspect angle as viewed from Earth. The resulting phase curve parameters were then filtered down to a subset of nearly 100,000 objects with high quality phase curves suitable for comparing the surface properties of different asteroid populations. Objects were selected that have sufficient phase angle coverage, high number of observations, low formal uncertainties from the fitting process, and no strong apparition effects. Results We have derived phase curve parameters for a large number of asteroids obtained in a consistent manner from a single survey over a long baseline and we find this dataset to be useful for a range of science cases. We shall present results comparing the distribution of phase parameters and surface colours measured in the ATLAS c - o filters of different asteroid populations. Considering the Jupiter Trojans, we can compare the properties of the leading and trailing dynamical groups and also assess trends in the "Red" and "Less-Red" compositional classes (Wong \& Brown, 2016). Alongside this phase curve database we have generated a list of \textasciitilde 5000 Main Belt and Jupiter Trojan asteroids that exhibit strong apparition effects. Such objects must have high spin axis obliquity and would make interesting targets for studies of asteroid spin axis evolution and shape modelling via lightcurve inversion. Only 25\% of the objects in our list are currently present in the Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB; Warner et al., 2021). In general our work highlights the possibilities and potential limitations of sparsely sampled photometric surveys for investigating the properties of large numbers of asteroids. The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will discover a huge number of new asteroids, however, characterisation of these objects will depend on survey design choices such as cadence and filter selection as well as follow up campaigns from other surveys/observers. Figure 1: ATLAS photometry for 766 Moguntia, an asteroid that shows clear apparition effects. Left: Phase curves for each apparition, fixing G = 0.15 and fitting only for H. Observations are colour-coded by apparition. Right: Absolute magnitude of Moguntia over time, where each observation has been corrected for distance and phase effects. Error bars indicate the fitted H and standard deviation of the residuals for each apparition, highlighting the shifts in brightness between apparitions and rotational brightness variations.

  abstract = {The taxonomic classification of asteroids has been mostly based on spectroscopic observations with wavelengths spanning from the visible (VIS) to the near-infrared (NIR). VIS-NIR spectra of {$\sim$}2500 asteroids have been obtained since the 1970s; the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Moving Object Catalog 4 (MOC 4) was released with {$\sim$}4 \texttimes{} 105 measurements of asteroid positions and colors in the early 2000s. A number of works then devised methods to classify these data within the framework of existing taxonomic systems. Some of these works, however, used 2D parameter space (e.g., gri slope vs. z-i color) that displayed a continuous distribution of clouds of data points resulting in boundaries that were artificially defined. We introduce here a more advanced method to classify asteroids based on existing systems. This approach is simply represented by a triplet of SDSS colors. The distributions and memberships of each taxonomic type are determined by machine learning methods in the form of both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. We apply our scheme to MOC 4 calibrated with VIS-NIR reflectance spectra. We successfully separate seven different taxonomy classifications (C, D, K, L, S, V, and X) with which we have a sufficient number of spectroscopic datasets. We found the overlapping regions of taxonomic types in a 2D plane were separated with relatively clear boundaries in the 3D space newly defined in this work. Our scheme explicitly discriminates between different taxonomic types (e.g., K and X types), which is an improvement over existing systems. This new method for taxonomic classification has a great deal of scalability for asteroid research, such as space weathering in the S-complex, and the origin and evolution of asteroid families. We present the structure of the asteroid belt, and describe the orbital distribution based on our newly assigned taxonomic classifications. It is also possible to extend the methods presented here to other photometric systems, such as the Johnson-Cousins and LSST filter systems.},

We concluded that for this population of HTCs, ranging in heliocentric distance from 1.21 to 2.66 au, there was no significant correlation between dust production and heliocentric distance, nor between gas production and heliocentric distance.},

Our observations on UT 2022 September 15 provided a pre-impact baseline and the first measure of Didymos-Dimorphos' spectral emissivity at \$\textbackslash lambda=0.87\$ mm, which was consistent with the handful of siliceous and carbonaceous asteroids measured at millimeter wavelengths. Our post-impact observations were conducted using four consecutive executions each of ALMA and the ACA spanning from T+3.52 to T+8.60 hours post-impact, sampling thermal emission from the asteroids and the impact ejecta. We scaled our pre-impact baseline measurement and subtracted it from the post-impact observations to isolate the flux density of mm-sized grains in the ejecta. Ejecta dust masses were calculated for a range of materials that may be representative of Dimorphos' S-type asteroid material. Depending on the material assumed, the average ejecta mass over our observations is consistent with 0.9--5.2\$\textbackslash times10\^7\$ kg, representing 0.2--1.2\% of Dimorphos' total mass and in agreement with ejecta mass estimates based on measurements at optical wavelengths. Our results provide the most sensitive measure of mm-sized material in the ejecta and demonstrate the power of ALMA for providing supporting observations to spaceflight missions.},

  abstract = {We report the first survey of molecular emission from cometary volatiles using standalone Atacama Compact Array (ACA) observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward comet C/2015 ER61 (PanSTARRS) carried out on UT 2017 April 11 and 15, shortly after its April 4 outburst. These measurements of HCN, CS, CH3OH, H2CO, and HNC (along with continuum emission from dust) probed the inner coma of C/2015 ER61, revealing asymmetric outgassing and discerning parent from daughter/distributed source species. This work presents spectrally integrated flux maps, autocorrelation spectra, production rates, and parent scale lengths for each molecule and a stringent upper limit for CO. HCN is consistent with direct nucleus release in C/2015 ER61, whereas CS, H2CO, HNC, and potentially CH3OH are associated with distributed sources in the coma. Adopting a Haser model, parent scale lengths determined for H2CO (Lp {$\sim$} 2200 km) and HNC (Lp {$\sim$} 3300 km) are consistent with previous work in comets, whereas significant extended source production (Lp {$\sim$} 2000 km) is indicated for CS, suggesting production from an unknown parent in the coma. The continuum presents a point-source distribution with a flux density implying an excessively large nucleus, inconsistent with other estimates of the nucleus size. It is best explained by the thermal emission of slowly moving outburst ejectas, with total mass 5\textendash 8 \texttimes{} 1010 kg. These results demonstrate the power of the ACA for revealing the abundances, spatial distributions, and locations of molecular production for volatiles in moderately bright comets such as C/2015 ER61.},

  abstract = {Understanding the cosmogonic record encoded in the parent volatiles stored in cometary nuclei requires investigating whether evolution (thermal or otherwise) has modified the composition of short-period comets during successive perihelion passages. As the most volatile molecules systematically observed in comets, the abundances of CO, CH4, and C2H6 in short-period comets may serve to elucidate the interplay between natal conditions and post-formative evolution in setting present-day composition, yet secure measurements of CO and CH4 in Jupiterfamily comets (JFCs) are especially sparse. The highly favorable 2018 apparition of JFC 21P/Giacobini\textendash Zinner enabled a sensitive search for these ``hypervolatiles'' in a prototypical carbon-chain depleted comet. We observed 21P/Giacobini\textendash Zinner with the iSHELL spectrograph at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on four preperihelion dates, two dates near-perihelion, and one post-perihelion date. We obtained detections of CO, CH4, and C2H6 simultaneously with H2O on multiple dates. We present rotational temperatures, production rates, and mixing ratios. Combined with previous work, our results may indicate that the hypervolatile coma composition of 21P/ Giacobini\textendash Zinner was variable across apparitions as well as within a particular perihelion passage, yet the spread in these measurements is a relatively small fraction of the variation in each molecule from comet to comet. We discuss the implications of our measured hypervolatile content of 21P/Giacobini\textendash Zinner for the evolution of JFCs, and place our results in the context of findings from the Rosetta mission and ground-based studies of comets.},

We conducted nearinfrared spectroscopic observations of 46P/Wirtanen using iSHELL at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on UT 2018 December 18 in direct coordination with observations using the newly upgraded NIRSPEC-2 instrument at the W.

We report rotational temperatures, production rates, and abundance ratios (i.e., mixing ratios) for all sampled species and compare our iSHELL results to simultaneous (or near-simultaneous) measurements taken with NIRSPEC-2. We demonstrate the extraordinary synergy of coordinated measurements using iSHELL and NIRSPEC-2, and advocate for future cometary studies that jointly leverage the capabilities of these two facilities.},

The object appears to be nearly spherical, showing a low amplitude light-curve variation and limited large-scale features in the radar images. The spin-state is difficult to constrain with the available data; including a certain light-curve subset significantly changes the spin-state estimates, and the uncertainties on period determination are significant. Constraining any change in rotation rate was not possible, despite decades of observations. The convex lightcurve-inversion model, with rotational pole at \$\{\textbackslash lambda\}=210\{\textbackslash pm\}41\$\{\textbackslash deg\} and \$\{\textbackslash beta\}=-30\{\textbackslash pm\}35\$\{\textbackslash deg\}, is more flattened than the two models reconstructed by including radar observations: with prograde (\$\{\textbackslash lambda\}=36\{\textbackslash pm\}23\$\{\textbackslash deg\}, \$\{\textbackslash beta\}=30\{\textbackslash pm\}15\$\{\textbackslash deg\}), and with retrograde rotation mode (\$\{\textbackslash lambda\}=180\{\textbackslash pm\}24\$\{\textbackslash deg\}, \$\{\textbackslash beta\}=-30\{\textbackslash pm\}16\$\{\textbackslash deg\}). Using data from WISE we were able to determine that the prograde model produces the best agreement in size determination between radar and thermophysical modelling. Radar measurements indicate possible variation in surface properties, suggesting one side might have lower radar albedo and be rougher at centimetre-to-decimetre scale than the other. However, further observations are needed to confirm this. Thermophysical analysis indicates a surface covered in fine-grained regolith, consistent with radar albedo and polarisation ratio measurements. Finally, geophysical investigation of the spin-stability of Tantalus shows that it could be exceeding its critical spin-rate via cohesive forces.},

Additionally, we obtained radar echo-power spectra and imaging observations with Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radar facilities in 2015, 2016, and 2017. We combined our data with published optical photometry to develop a robust physical model. Results. We determine that the rotation pole resides at negative latitudes in an area with a 5{$\smwhtcircle$} radius close to the south ecliptic pole. The refined sidereal rotation period is 6.536787 {$\pm$} 0.000007 h. The radar images are best reproduced with a bilobed shape model. Both lobes of 1999 JV6 can be represented as oblate ellipsoids with a smaller, more spherical component resting at the end of a larger, more elongated component. While contact binaries appear to be abundant in the near-Earth population, there are only a few published shape models for asteroids in this particular configuration. By combining the radar-derived shape model with optical light curves we determine a constant-period solution that fits all available data well. Using light-curve data alone we determine an upper limit for YORP of 8.5 \texttimes{} 10-8 rad day-2. Conclusions. The bifurcated shape of 1999 JV6 might be a result of two ellipsoidal components gently merging with each other, or a deformation of a rubble pile with a weak-tensile-strength core due to spin-up. The physical model of 1999 JV6 presented here will enable future studies of contact binary asteroid formation and evolution.},

Investigating their molecular and elemental composition takes us on a journey back to the early period of our Solar system and possibly even further. In this work, we deduce the bulk abundances of the major volatile species in comet 67P/ChuryumovGerasimenko, the target of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosetta mission. The basis are measurements obtained with the ROSINA instrument suite on board the Rosetta orbiter during a suitable period of high outgassing near perihelion. The results are combined with both gas and dust composition measurements published in the literature. This provides an integrated inventory of the major elements present in the nucleus of 67P/ChuryumovGerasimenko. Similar to comet 1P/Halley, which was visited by ESA's Giotto spacecraft in 1986, comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko also shows near-solar abundances of oxygen and carbon, whereas hydrogen and nitrogen are depleted compared to solar. Still, the degree of devolatilization is lower than that of inner Solar system objects, including meteorites and the Earth. This supports the idea that comets are amongst the most pristine objects in our Solar system.},

Here we aim to understand how the rocky morphology of minor bodies react to the well known space erosion agents on the Moon. We deploy a neural network and map a total of \textasciitilde 130,000 fragmented boulders scattered across the lunar surface and visually identify a dozen different desintegration morphologies corresponding to different failure modes. We find that several fragmented boulder morphologies are equivalent to morphologies observed on asteroid Bennu, suggesting that these morphologies on the Moon and on asteroids are likely not diagnostic of their formation mechanism. Our findings suggest that the boulder fragmentation process is characterized by an internal weakening period with limited morphological signs of damage at rock scale until a sudden highly efficient impact shattering event occurs. In addition, we identify new morphologies such as breccia boulders with an advection-like erosion style. We publicly release the produced fractured boulder catalog along with this paper.},

  abstract = {Increasing our knowledge of the orbits and compositions of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) is important for a better understanding of the evolution of the Solar System and of life. The detection of serendipitous NEO appearances among the millions of archived exposures from large astronomical imaging surveys can provide a contribution which is complementary to NEO surveys. Using the AstroWISE information system, this work aims to assess the detectability rate, the achieved recovery rate and the quality of astrometry when data mining the ESO archive for the OmegaCAM wide-field imager at the VST. We developed an automatic pipeline that searches for the NEO appearances inside the AstroWISE environment. Throughout the recovery process, the pipeline uses several public web-tools to identify possible images that overlap with the position of NEOs, and acquires information on the NEOs predicted position and other properties (e.g., magnitude, rate and direction of motion) at the time of observations. We have recovered 196 appearances of NEOs from a set of 968 appearances predicted to be recoverable. It includes appearances for three NEOs which were on the impact risk list at that point. These appearances were well before their discovery. The subsequent risk assessment using the extracted astrometry removes these NEOs from the risk list. We estimate a detectability rate of 0.05 per NEO at an SNR{$>$}3 for NEOs in the OmegaCAM archive. Our automatic recovery rates are 40\% and 20\% for NEOs on the risk list and the full list, respectively. The achieved astrometric and photometric accuracy is on average 0.12 arcsec and 0.1 mag. These results show the high potential of the archival imaging data of the ground-based wide-field surveys as useful instruments for the search, (p)recovery and characterization of NEOs. Highly automated approaches, as possible using AstroWISE, make this undertaking feasible.},

We used three iSHELL settings (covering {$\sim$}2.8\textendash 5.2 {$\mu$}m) to sample fluorescent emissions from H2O, OH, CH3OH, HCN, C2H2, NH3, CO, CH4, C2H6, H2CO, and OCS on multiple dates ranging from UT 2017 April 15 (shortly after its April 4 outburst) to May 13, nearly 30 days before the detection of its double nucleus. Our observations also offered the opportunity to obtain sensitive 3s upper limits for cyanoacetylene (HC3N). We report rotational temperatures (Trot), production rates (Qs), abundance (mixing) ratios (relative to H2O and C2H6), and spatial distributions in the coma. ER61 exhibits variability in production rates of many species on short (day-to-day) and long (pre- versus post-perihelion) timescales. The relative abundances of these volatile species remained consistent within uncertainties during our pre-perihelion observations but tended to decrease during our post-perihelion observations (with the exception of CH3OH and HCN). The short-timescale variability in the production rates of these volatiles could be due to diurnal effects (over the course of the rotation of the nucleus) and/or the effect of its outburst. The decrease in the production rates and hence the mixing ratios in some volatiles in post-perihelion dates could be due to the presence of seasonal effects in ER61.},

For four nuclei for which rotational changes are well documented, despite the nearly factor 30 variation observed among the effective active fractions of these comets, X is constant to within a factor two. We present an analysis for the sungrazing comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) to explore what rotational changes it could undergo during the upcoming perihelion passage where its perihelion distance will be {$\sim$}2.7 solar radii. When close to the Sun, barring a catastrophic disruption of the nucleus, the activity of ISON will be sufficiently strong to put the nucleus into a non-principal-axis rotational state and observable changes to the rotational period should also occur. Additional causes for rotational state changes near perihelion for ISON are tidal torques caused by the Sun and the significant mass loss due to a number of mechanisms resulting in alterations to the moments of inertia of the nucleus.},

Because of this, their identification and study provide us with a unique opportunity to learn more about the formation and evolution of this particular type of bodies, as well as their relationship with meteorites found on Earth. We present near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic data of NEAs 6178 (1986 DA) and 2016 ED85. We found that the spectral characteristics of these objects are consistent with those of metal-rich asteroids, showing red slopes, convex shapes, and a weak pyroxene absorption band at {$\sim$}0.93 \textmu m. The compositional analysis showed that they have a pyroxene chemistry of Fs40.6{$\pm$}3.3Wo8.9{$\pm$}1.1 and a mineral abundance of {$\sim$}15\% pyroxene and 85\% metal. We determined that these objects were likely transported to the near-Earth space via the 5:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. Asteroid spectra were compared with the spectra of mesosiderites and bencubbinites. Differences in the NIR spectra and pyroxene chemistry suggest that bencubbinites are not good meteorite analogs. Mesosiderites were found to have a similar pyroxene chemistry and produced a good spectral match when metal was added to the silicate component. We estimated that the amounts of Fe, Ni, Co, and the platinum group metals present in 1986 DA could exceed the reserves worldwide.},

For precision measurements of cosmological parameters and rates, it is critical to understand the detection efficiency, magnitude limits, artifact contamination levels, and biases in the selection and photometry. Here we rigorously test the LSST Difference Image Analysis (DIA) pipeline using simulated images from the Rubin Observatory LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Data Challenge (DC2) simulation for the Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) survey area. DC2 is the first large-scale (300 deg\$\^2\$) image simulation of a transient survey that includes realistic cadence, variable observing conditions, and CCD image artifacts. We analyze \$\{\textbackslash sim\}\$15 deg\$\^2\$ of DC2 over a 5-year time-span in which artificial point-sources from Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) light curves have been overlaid onto the images. We measure the detection efficiency as a function of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and find a \$50\textbackslash\%\$ efficiency at \$\textbackslash rm\{SNR\}=5.8\$. The magnitude limits for each filter are: \$u=23.66\$, \$g=24.69\$, \$r=24.06\$, \$i=23.45\$, \$z=22.54\$, \$y=21.62\$ \$\textbackslash rm\{mag\}\$.

The photometry has biases \${$<$}1\textbackslash\%\$ for magnitudes \$19.5 {$<$} m {$<$}23\$. Our DIA performance on simulated images is similar to that of the Dark Energy Survey pipeline applied to real images. We also characterize DC2 image properties to produce catalog-level simulations needed for distance bias corrections. We find good agreement between DC2 data and simulations for distributions of SNR, redshift, and fitted light-curve properties. Applying a realistic SNIa-cosmology analysis for redshifts \$z{$<$}1\$, we recover the input cosmology parameters to within statistical uncertainties.},

  abstract = {The goal of the present paper is to develop a simplified model to describe the gravitational fields of elongated asteroids. The proposed model consists of representing an elongated asteroid using a triple-particle-linkage system distributed in the threedimensional space and it is an extension of previous planar models. A non-linear optimisation method is used to determine the parameters of our model, minimising the errors of all the external equilibrium points with respect to the solutions calculated with a more realistic approach, the Mascon model, which are assumed to give the real values of the system. The model considered in this article is then applied to three real irregular asteroids: 1620 Geographos, 433 Eros, and 243 Ida. The results show that the current triple-particle-linkage three-dimensional model gives better accuracy when compared to the axisymmetric tripleparticle-linkage model available in the literature, and provides an advantage in terms of accuracy over the mass point model, while keeping computational time low. This model is also used to carry out simulations to characterise regions with solutions that remain bounded or that escape from around each asteroid under analysis. We investigated initial inclinations of 0{$\smwhtcircle$} (direct orbits) and 180{$\smwhtcircle$} (retrograde orbits). We considered the gravitational field of the asteroid, the gravitational attraction of the Sun, and the SRP. Our results are then compared to the results obtained using the Mascon gravitational model, based on the polyhedral shape source. We found good agreement between the two models.},

These were constructed from 778 magnitudes taken with the 1.3-m telescope on Cerro Tololo as operated by a service observer for the SMARTS consortium. Over our typical phase range of 0.2\textendash 10\textdegree, we find our phase curves to be adequately described by a linear model, for slopes of 0.04\textendash 0.09 mag/\textdegree{} with average uncertainty less than 0.02 mag/\textdegree. (The one exception, 51378 (2001 AT33), has a formally negative slope of \`A0.02 {$\pm$} 0.01 mag/\textdegree.) These slopes are too steep for the opposition surge mechanism to be shadow-hiding (SH), so we conclude that the dominant surge mechanism must be coherent backscattering (CB). In a detailed comparison of surface properties (including surge slope, B\textendash R color, and albedo), we find that the Trojans have surface properties similar to the P and C class asteroids prominent in the outer main belt, yet they have significantly different surge properties (at a confidence level of 99.90\%). This provides an imperfect argument against the traditional idea that the Trojans were formed around Jupiter's orbit. We also find no overlap in Trojan properties with either the main belt asteroids or with the small icy bodies in the outer Solar System. Importantly, we find that the Trojans are indistinguishable from other small bodies in the outer Solar System that have lost their surface ices (such as the gray Centaurs, gray Scattered Disk Objects, and dead comets). Thus, we find strong support for the idea that the Trojans originally formed as icy bodies in the outer Solar System, were captured into their current orbits during the migration of the gas giant planets, and subsequently lost all their surface ices.},

The comet continues to exhibit a large asymmetry in production rates as a function of time and heliocentric distance, with production reaching a peak 3-5 weeks prior to perihelion. All species, including dust, follow the same general production rate curve each apparition, and the carbon-bearing species are always very similar to one another. However, OH and NH each differ in detail from the carbon-bearing species, implying somewhat varied composition between source regions. Longer term, there are only small secular changes among the apparitions before and near perihelion, but larger changes are evident as the comet recedes from the Sun, suggestive of a progressive precession of the rotation axis.},

  abstract = {Narrowband-filter photometry of Comet 96P/Machholz 1 was obtained at Lowell Observatory during the comet's 2007 apparition. Production rates of OH, CN, C2, C3, and NH were derived from these data sets, and the quantity A(\texttheta{} )f{$\rho$}\textemdash a proxy measure of the dust production\textemdash was also calculated. Relative abundances, expressed as ratios of production rates with respect to OH (a measure of the water abundance), were compared to those measured in other comets. Comet Machholz 1 is shown to be depleted of CN by about a factor of 72 from average, while C2 and C3 are also low, but ``only'' by factors of 8 and 19, respectively, from ``typical'' composition (based on an update to the classifications by A'Hearn et al.). In contrast, NH is near the mid-to-upper end of its normal range. This extremely low CN-to-OH ratio for Machholz 1 indicates that it is either compositionally associated with Comet Yanaka (1988r; 1988 Y1), which was strongly depleted in CN and C2, but not NH2, or represents a new compositional class of comets, since Yanaka had a much greater depletion of C2 ({$>$}100\texttimes ) than did Machholz 1 (8\texttimes ). Evidence strongly suggests that the extremely anomalous compositions of these two comets are primordial rather than from recent thermal processing. It remains unclear whether these comets formed at a location in our solar system with unusual conditions and a low probability of being gravitationally perturbed into the inner solar system, or if one or both objects are interstellar interlopers.},

  abstract = {Runaway growth is an important stage in planet formation during which large protoplanets form, while most of the initial mass remains in small planetesimals. The amount of mass converted into large protoplanets and their resulting size distribution are not well understood. Here, we use analytic work, that we confirm by coagulation simulations, to describe runaway growth and the corresponding evolution of the velocity dispersion. We find that runaway growth proceeds as follows. Initially, all the mass resides in small planetesimals, with mass surface density {$\sigma$} , and large protoplanets start to form by accreting small planetesimals. This growth continues until growth by merging large protoplanets becomes comparable to growth by planetesimal accretion. This condition sets in when {$\Sigma$}/{$\sigma$} {$\sim$} {$\alpha$}3/4 {$\sim$} 10-3, where {$\Sigma$} is the mass surface density in protoplanets in a given logarithmic mass interval and {$\alpha$} is the ratio of the size of a body to its Hill radius. From then on, protoplanetary growth and the evolution of the velocity dispersion become self-similar and {$\Sigma$} remains roughly constant, since an increase in {$\Sigma$} by accretion of small planetesimals is balanced by a decrease due to merging with large protoplanets. We show that this growth leads to a protoplanet size distribution given by N ({$>$}R) {$\propto$} R-3, where N ({$>$}R) is the number of objects with radii greater than R (i.e., a differential power-law index of 4). Since only the largest bodies grow significantly during runaway growth, {$\Sigma$} and thereby the size distribution are preserved. We apply our results to the Kuiper Belt, which is a relic of runaway growth where planet formation never proceeded to completion. Our results successfully match the observed Kuiper Belt size distribution, they illuminate the physical processes that shaped it and explain the total mass that is present in large Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) today. This work suggests that the current mass in large KBOs is primordial and that it has not been significantly depleted. We also predict a maximum mass ratio for Kuiper Belt binaries that formed by dynamical processes of {$\alpha-$}1/4 {$\sim$} 10, which explains the observed clustering in binary companion sizes that is seen in the cold classical belt. Finally, our results also apply to growth in debris disks, as long as frequent planetesimal\textendash planetesimal collisions are not important during the growth.},

  abstract = {The supersolar abundances of volatiles observed in giant planets suggest that a compositional gradient was present at the time of their formation in the protosolar nebula. To explain this gradient, several studies have investigated the radial transport of trace species and the effect of icelines on the abundance profiles of solids and vapors formed in the disk. However, these models only consider the presence of solids in the forms of pure condensates or amorphous ice during the evolution of the protosolar nebula. They usually neglect the possible crystallization and destabilization of clathrates, along with the resulting interplay between the abundance of water and those of these crystalline forms. This study is aimed at pushing this kind of investigation further by considering all possible solid phases together in the protosolar nebula: pure condensates, amorphous ice, and clathrates. To this end, we used a one-dimensional (1D) protoplanetary disk model coupled with modules describing the evolution of trace species in the vapor phase, as well as the dynamics of dust and pebbles. Eleven key species are considered here, including H\$\_2\$O, CO, CO\$\_2\$, CH\$\_4\$, H\$\_2\$S, N\$\_2\$, NH\$\_3\$, Ar, Kr, Xe, and PH\$\_3\$. Two sets of initial conditions are explored for the protosolar nebula. In a first scenario, the disk is initially filled with icy grains in the forms of pure condensates. In this case, we show that clathrates can crystallize and form enrichment peaks up to about ten times the initial abundances at their crystallization lines. In a second scenario, the volatiles were delivered to the protosolar nebula in the forms of amorphous grains. In this case, the presence of clathrates is not possible because there is no available crystalline water ice in their formation region. Enrichment peaks of pure condensates also form beyond the snowline up to about seven times the initial abundances.},

  abstract = {In dead zones of protoplanetary discs, it is assumed that micrometre-sized particles grow Brownian, sediment to the midplane and drift radially inward. When collisional compaction sets in, the growing aggregates collect slower and therefore dynamically smaller particles. This sedimentation and growth phase of highly porous ice and dust aggregates is simulated with laboratory experiments in which we obtained mm- to cm-sized ice aggregates with a porosity of 90\textbackslash\% as well as cm-sized dust agglomerates with a porosity of 85\textbackslash\%. We modelled the growth process during sedimentation in an analytical calculation to compute the agglomerate sizes when they reach the midplane of the protoplanetary disc. In the midplane, the dust particles form a thin dense layer and gain relative velocities by, e.g., the streaming instability or the onset of shear turbulence. To investigate also these collisions, we performed additional laboratory drop tower experiments with the high-porosity aggregates formed in the sedimentary-growth experiments and determined their mechanical parameters, including their sticking threshold velocity, which is important for their further collisional evolution on their way to form planetesimals. Finally, we developed a method to calculate the packing-density-dependent fundamental properties of our dust and ice agglomerates, the Young's modulus, the Poisson ratio, the shear viscosity and the bulk viscosity from compression measurements. With these parameters, it was possible to derive the coefficient of restitution which fits our measurements. In order to physically describe these outcomes, we applied a collision model. With this model, predictions about general dust-aggregate collisions are possible.},

This multiband wide-field synoptic survey will transform our view of the solar system, with the discovery and monitoring of over five million small bodies. The final survey strategy chosen for LSST has direct implications on the discoverability and characterization of solar system minor planets and passing interstellar objects. Creating an inventory of the solar system is one of the four main LSST science drivers. The LSST observing cadence is a complex optimization problem that must balance the priorities and needs of all the key LSST science areas. To design the best LSST survey strategy, a series of operation simulations using the Rubin Observatory scheduler have been generated to explore the various options for tuning observing parameters and prioritizations. We explore the impact of the various simulated LSST observing strategies on studying the solar system's small body reservoirs. We examine what are the best observing scenarios and review what are the important considerations for maximizing LSST solar system science. In general, most of the LSST cadence simulations produce {$\pm$}5\% or less variations in our chosen key metrics, but a subset of the simulations significantly hinder science returns with much larger losses in the discovery and light-curve metrics.},

These models predict that the Kuiper Belt should contain a small fraction of objects with carbonaceous surfaces, though to date, all reported visible reflectance spectra of small Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) are linear and featureless. We report the unusual reflectance spectrum of a small KBO, (120216) 2004EW95, exhibiting a large drop in its near-UV reflectance and a broad shallow optical absorption feature centered at {$\sim$}700nm, which is detected at greater than 4{$\sigma$} significance. These features, confirmed through multiple epochs of spectral photometry and spectroscopy, have respectively been associated with ferric oxides and phyllosilicates. The spectrum bears striking resemblance to those of some C-type asteroids, suggesting that 2004EW95 may share a common origin with those objects. 2004EW95 orbits the Sun in a stable mean motion resonance with Neptune, at relatively high eccentricity and inclination, suggesting it may have been emplaced there by some past dynamical instability. These results appear consistent with the aforementioned model predictions and are the first to show a reliably confirmed detection of silicate material on a small KBO.},

(1973). It has also thrived thanks to a dramatic improvement in the quality of astrometric observations in the past decades. A set of 78 long-period comets with derived nongravitational accelerations and perihelion distances smaller than 2 AU has been assembled and its cumulative distribution shown to mirror the distribution of nuclear dimensions, once the bias toward bright comets and comets with large nongravitational effects is accounted for.

The acceleration persisted over a period of two centuries, but its rate was gradually decreasing. Generations of cometary astronomers were curious to know whether or not the comet would eventually move in purely gravitational orbit. A model based on the assumption of a precession of the comet's nucleus, which predicted that the acceleration would change into a deceleration, was not published until 1979. This transition has now been documented by two independent, highly-accurate orbit determinations. The era of the comet's persevering nongravitational acceleration is finally over.},

  abstract = {We report statistically significant detections of non-radial nongravitational accelerations based on astrometric data in the photometrically inactive objects 1998 KY\$\_\{26\}\$, 2005 VL\$\_1\$, 2016 NJ\$\_\{33\}\$, 2010 VL\$\_\{65\}\$, 2016 RH\$\_\{120\}\$, and 2010 RF\$\_\{12\}\$. The magnitudes of the nongravitational accelerations are greater than those typically induced by the Yarkovsky effect and there is no radiation-based, non-radial effect that can be so large. Therefore, we hypothesize that the accelerations are driven by outgassing, and calculate implied H\$\_2\$O production rates for each object. We attempt to reconcile outgassing induced acceleration with the lack of visible comae or photometric activity via the absence of surface dust and low levels of gas production. Although these objects are small and some are rapidly rotating, surface cohesive forces are stronger than the rotational forces and rapid rotation alone cannot explain the lack of surface debris. It is possible that surface dust was removed previously, perhaps via outgassing activity that increased the rotation rates to their present day value. We calculate dust production rates of order \$\textbackslash sim10\^\{-4\}\$ g s\$\^\{-1\}\$ in each object assuming that the nuclei are bare, within the upper limits of dust production from a sample stacked image of 1998 KY\$\_\{26\}\$ of \$\textbackslash dot\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash rm Dust\}{$<$}0.2\$ g s\$\^\{-1\}\$. This production corresponds to brightness variations of order \$\textbackslash sim0.0025\textbackslash\%\$, which are undetectable in extant photometric data. We assess the future observability of each of these targets, and find that the orbit of 1998 KY\$\_\{26\}\$ -- which is also the target for the extended Hayabusa2 mission -- exhibits favorable viewing geometry before 2025.},

The first interstellar object, 1I/`Oumuamua, passed within \$\textbackslash sim63\$ lunar distances of the Earth, appeared asteroidal lacking detectable levels of gas or dust loss, yet exhibited a nongravitational acceleration. 1I/`Oumuamua's brief visit left open questions regarding its provenance which has given rise to many theoretical hypotheses, including an icy comet lacking a dust coma, an elongated fragment of a planet or planetesimal that was tidally disrupted, and an ultra-porous fractal aggregate. The second interstellar object, 2I/Borisov, was distinct from 1I/`Oumuamua in terms of its bulk physical properties and displayed a definitive cometary tail. We review the discoveries of these objects, the subsequent observations and characterizations, and the theoretical hypotheses regarding their origins. We describe 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov in the context of active asteroids and comets in the Solar System. The discovery of these two objects implies a galactic-wide population of \$\textbackslash sim10\^\{26\}\$ similar bodies. Forthcoming observatories should detect many more interstellar planetesimals which may offer new insights into how planetary formation processes vary throughout the Galaxy.},

We investigate the dynamical transfer of Centaurs into the inner Solar System, facilitated by mean motion resonances with Jupiter and Saturn. The recently discovered object, P/2019 LD2, will transition from the Centaur region to the inner Solar System in 2063. In order to contextualize LD2, we perform N-body simulations of a population of Centaurs and JFCs. Objects between Jupiter and Saturn with Tisserand parameter TJ {$\sim$}3 are transferred onto orbits with perihelia q {$<$} 4au within the next 1000 years with notably high efficiency. Our simulations show that there may be additional LD2-like objects transitioning into the inner Solar System in the near-term future, all of which have low {$\increment$}V with respect to Jupiter. We calculate the distribution of orbital elements resulting from a single Jovian encounter and show that objects with initial perihelia close to Jupiter are efficiently scattered to q {$<$} 4au. Moreover, approximately 55\% of the transitioning objects in our simulated population experience at least 1 Jovian encounter prior to reaching q {$<$} 4au. We demonstrate that a spacecraft stationed near Jupiter would be well-positioned to rendezvous, orbit match, and accompany LD2 into the inner Solar System, providing an opportunity to observe the onset of intense activity in a pristine comet in situ. Finally, we discuss the prospect of identifying additional targets for similar measurements with forthcoming observational facilities.},

We advocate for future measurements of the production rates of H\$\_2\$O, CO\$\_2\$ and CO in these comets to estimate their carbon to oxygen ratios, which traces formation locations within their original protoplanetary disks. We review similar measurements for Solar System comets, which indicate formation interior to the CO snowline. By quantifying the relative processing in the interstellar medium and Solar System, we estimate that production rates will not be representative of primordial compositions for the majority of interstellar comets. Preferential desorption of CO and CO\$\_2\$ relative to H\$\_2\$O in the interstellar medium implies that measured C/O ratios represent lower limits on the primordial ratios. Specifically, production rate ratios of \$\{\textbackslash rm Q\}(\{\textbackslash rm CO\})/\{\textbackslash rm Q\}(\{\textbackslash rm H\_2O\}){$<$}.2\$ and \$\{\textbackslash rm Q\}(\{\textbackslash rm CO\})/\{\textbackslash rm Q\}(\{\textbackslash rm H\_2O\}){$>$}1\$ likely indicate formation interior and exterior to the CO snowline, respectively. The high C/O ratio of 2I/Borisov implies that it formed exterior to the CO snowline. We provide an overview of the currently operational facilities capable of obtaining these measurements that will constrain the fraction of ejected comets that formed exterior to the CO snowline. This fraction will provide key insights into the efficiency of and mechanisms for cometary ejection in exoplanetary systems.},

We release a catalog of 880,528 individual observations, consisting of 205,515 known and unique SSOs. The catalog completeness is estimated to be about 97\% down to V=18 mag and the purity to be above 95\% for known SSOs.

The present catalog contributes significantly to the sample of asteroids with known surface properties (about 40\% of main-belt asteroids down to an absolute magnitude of 16).

  abstract = {The most pristine remnants of the Solar system's planet formation epoch orbit the Sun beyond Neptune, the small bodies of the trans-Neptunian object populations. The bulk of the mass is in {$\sim$} 100 km objects, but objects at smaller sizes have undergone minimal collisional processing, with ``New Horizons'' recently revealing that {$\sim$} 20 km effective diameter body (486958) Arrokoth appears to be a primordial body, not a collisional fragment. This indicates bodies at these sizes (and perhaps smaller) retain a record of how they were formed, and are the most numerous record of that epoch. However, such bodies are impractical to find by optical surveys due to their very low brightnesses. Their presence can be inferred from the observed cratering record of Pluto and Charon, and directly measured by serendipitous stellar occultations. These two methods produce conflicting results, with occultations measuring roughly ten times the number of {$\sim$} km bodies inferred from the cratering record. We use numerical models to explore how these observations can be reconciled with evolutionary models of the outer Solar system. We find that models where the initial size of bodies decreases with increasing semimajor axis of formation, and models where the surface density of bodies increases beyond the 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Neptune can produce both sets of observations, though comparison to various observational tests favours the former mechanism. We discuss how to evaluate the astrophysical plausibility of these solutions, and conclude extended serendipitous occultation surveys with broad sky coverage are the most practical approach.},

We also discovered one new Apollo type Near Earth Object (NEO) that crosses Earth's orbit, 2022 AP7. Two of the discoveries likely have diameters greater than 1 km. 2022 AP7 is likely the largest Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA) discovered in about eight years. To date we have covered 624 square degrees of sky near to and interior to the orbit of Venus. The average images go to 21.3 mags in the r-band, with the best images near 22nd mag. Our new discovery 2021 PH27 has the smallest semi-major axis known for an asteroid, 0.4617 au, and the largest general relativistic effects (53 arcseconds/century) known for any body in the Solar System. The survey has detected about 15 percent of all known Atira NEOs. We put strong constraints on any stable population of Venus co-orbital resonance objects existing, as well as the Atira and Vatira asteroid classes. These interior asteroid populations are important to complete the census of asteroids near Earth, including some of the most likely Earth impactors that cannot easily be discovered in other surveys. Comparing the actual population of asteroids found interior to Earth and Venus with those predicted to exist by extrapolating from the known population exterior to Earth is important to better understand the origin, composition and structure of the NEO population.},

  abstract = {In the last 20 years, over 600 impact flashes have been documented on the lunar surface. This wealth of data presents a unique opportunity to study the meteoroid flux of the Earth-Moon environment, and in recent years the physical properties of the impactors. However, other than through serendipitous events, there has not been yet a systematic search and discovery of the craters associated to these events. Such a meteoroid-crater link would allow us to get insight into the crater formation via these live observations of collisions. Here we present the PyNAPLE (Python NAC Automated Pair Lunar Evaluator) software pipeline for locating newly formed craters using the location and epoch of an observed impact flash. We present the first results from PyNAPLE, having been implemented on the 2017-09-27 impact flash. A rudimentary analysis on the impact flash and linked impact crater is also performed, finding that the crater's ejecta pattern indicates an impact angle between 10-30\textbackslash degree, and although the rim-to-rim diameter of the crater is not resolvable in current LRO NAC images, using crater scaling laws we predict this diameter to be 24.1-55.3\textasciitilde m, and using ejecta scaling predict a diameter of 27.3-37.7\textasciitilde m. We discuss how PyNAPLE will enable large scale analyses of sub-kilometer scale cratering rates and refinement of both scaling laws, and the luminous efficiency.},

The Two-Line Element (TLE) data provided by the North American Aerospace Defense Command is the most comprehensive and widely-available dataset cataloguing the orbits of satellites. This makes it a highly-attractive data source on which to perform this observation. However, when attempting to infer changes in satellite behaviour from TLE data, there are a number of potential pitfalls. These mostly relate to specific features of the TLE data which are not always clearly documented in the data sources or popular software packages for manipulating them. These quirks produce a particularly hazardous data type for researchers from adjacent disciplines (such as anomaly detection or machine learning). We highlight these features of TLE data and the resulting pitfalls in order to save future researchers from being trapped. A seperate, significant, issue is that existing contributions to manoeuvre detection from TLE data evaluate their algorithms on different satellites, making comparison between these methods difficult. Moreover, the ground-truth in these datasets is often poor quality, sometimes being based on subjective human assessment. We therefore release and describe in-depth an open, curated, benchmark dataset containing TLE data for 15 satellites alongside high-quality ground-truth manoeuvre timestamps.},

We apply a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for asteroid mass and orbit estimation by modeling asteroidasteroid close encounters to four separate large asteroids in an attempt to estimate their masses based on multiple simultaneously studied close encounters with multiple test asteroids. In order to validate our algorithm and data treatment, we apply the MCMC algorithm to pure orbit determination for the main-belt asteroid (367) Amicitia and compare the residuals to previously published ones. In addition, we attempt to estimate a mass for (445) Edna with Gaia astrometry alone based on its close encounter with (1764) Cogshall. Results. In the case of the orbit of (367) Amicitia, we find a solution that improves on the previously published solution. The study of (445) Edna reveals that mass estimation with DR2 astrometry alone is unfeasible and that it must be combined with astrometry from other sources to achieve meaningful results. We find that a combination of DR2 and Earth-based astrometry results in dramatically reduced uncertainties and, by extension, significantly improved results in comparison to those computed based on less accurate Earthbased astrometry alone. Conclusions. Our mass estimation algorithm works well with a combination of Gaia DR2 and Earth-based astrometry and provides very impressive results with significantly reduced uncertainties. We note that the DR2 has a caveat in that many asteroids suitable for mass-estimation purposes are not included in the relatively small sample. This limits the number of asteroids to which mass estimation can be applied. However, this issue will largely be corrected with the forthcoming third Gaia data release, which is expected to allow for a wave of numerous accurate mass estimates for a wide range of asteroids.},

We aim to make a spectral characterization for a large sample of NEOs with {$\mathsl{T}\mathsl{J}$} {$\leq$} 3.1. Consequently, we can estimate the fraction of bodies with a cometary origin. We report new spectral observations for 26 low-T{$\mathsl{J}$} NEOs. The additional spectra, retrieved from different public databases, allowed us to perform the analysis over a catalogue of 150 objects. We classified them with respect to Bus-DeMeo taxonomic system. The results are discussed regarding their orbital parameters. The taxonomic distribution of low-{$\mathsl{T}\mathsl{J}$} NEOs differs from the entire NEOs population. Consequently, {$\mathsl{T}\mathsl{J}$} {$\sim$}3 can act as a composition border too. We found that 56.2 per cent of low-T{$\mathsl{J}$} NEOs have comet-like spectra and they become abundant (79.7 per cent) for T{$\mathsl{J}$} {$\leq$} 2.8. 16 D-type objects have been identified in this population, distributed on orbits with an average T{$\mathsl{J}$} = 2.65 {$\pm$} 0.6. Using two dynamical criteria, together with the comet-like spectral classification as an identification method and by applying an observational bias correction, we estimate that the fraction of NEOs with a cometary nature and H {$\in$} (14, 21) mag has the lower and upper bounds (1.5 {$\pm$} 0.15) and (10.4 {$\pm$} 2.2) per cent. Additionally, our observations show that all extreme cases of low-perihelion asteroids (q {$\leq$} 0.3 au) belong to S-complex.},

Singer               et al.               examined impact craters on Pluto and its moon Charon. Some regions have had their impact craters erased by recent geological processes, but others appear to record 4 billion years of impacts. Because Pluto and Charon are located in the Kuiper belt, the distribution of crater sizes reflects the size distribution of impacting Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). The authors found fewer small KBOs than predicted by models of collision equilibrium, implying that some of the KBO population has been preserved since the formation of the Solar System.

Impact craters on Pluto and Charon were formed by collisions with other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) with diameters from \textasciitilde 40 kilometers to \textasciitilde 300 meters, smaller than most KBOs observed directly by telescopes. We find a relative paucity of small craters {$\lessequivlnt$}13 kilometers in diameter, which cannot be explained solely by geological resurfacing. This implies a deficit of small KBOs ({$\lessequivlnt$}1 to 2 kilometers in diameter). Some surfaces on Pluto and Charon are likely {$\greaterequivlnt$}4 billion years old, thus their crater records provide information on the size-frequency distribution of KBOs in the early Solar System.},

IM1 and IM2 are ranked 1 and 3 in terms of material strength out of all 273 fireballs in the CNEOS catalog. Fitting a log-normal distribution to material strengths of objects in the CNEOS catalog, IM1 and IM2 are outliers at the levels of \$3.5 \textbackslash sigma\$ and \$2.6 \textbackslash sigma\$, respectively. The random sampling and Gaussian probabilities, respectively, of picking two objects with such high material strength from the CNEOS catalog, are \$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-4\}\$ and \$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-6\}\$. If IM2 is confirmed, this implies that interstellar meteors come from a population with material strength characteristically higher than meteors originating from within the solar system. Additionally, we find that if the two objects are representative of a background population on random trajectories, their combined detections imply that \$\textbackslash sim 40\textbackslash\%\$ of all refractory elements are locked in meter-scale interstellar objects.

The Danish telescope, which was commissioned in 1979, is limited by a triangular coma at spatial resolutions below , and better results will thus be achieved at the near diffraction-limited optical system on the SONG telescopes, where spatial resolutions close to have been achieved. Regular EMCCD operations have been running at the Danish telescope for several years and produced a number of scientific discoveries, including microlensing detected exoplanets, detecting previously unknown variable stars in dense globular clusters, and discovering two rings around the small asteroid-like object (10199) Chariklo.},

Here we report rotation lightcurves of nineteen Koronis family members, and derived results that increase the sample of determined spin vectors in the Koronis family to include 34 of the largest 36 family members, completing it to \$H \textbackslash approx 11.3\$ (\$D \textbackslash sim 16\$ km) for the largest 32 members. The program observations were made during a total of 72 apparitions between 2005-2021, and are reported here along with several earlier unpublished lightcurves. All of the reported data were analyzed together with previously published lightcurves to determine the objects' sidereal rotation periods, spin vector orientations, and convex model shape solutions. The derived distributions of retrograde rotation rates and pole obliquities appear to be qualitatively consistent with outcomes of modification by thermal YORP torques. The distribution of spin rates for the prograde rotators remains narrower than that for the retrograde rotators; in particular, the absence of prograde rotators having periods longer than about 20 h is real, while among the retrograde rotators are several objects having longer periods up to about 65 h. None of the prograde objects newly added to the sample appear to be trapped in an \$s\_6\$ spin-orbit resonance that is characteristic of most of the largest prograde objects; these smaller objects either could have been trapped previously and have already evolved out, or have experienced spin evolution tracks that did not include the resonance.},

  abstract = {The Asteroid Terrestrial impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) system consists of two 0.5 m Schmidt telescopes with cameras covering 29 square degrees at plate scale of 1.86 arcsec per pixel. Working in tandem, the telescopes routinely survey the whole sky visible from Hawaii (above d {$>$} -50) every two nights, exposing four times per night, typically reaching o {$<$} 19 magnitude per exposure when the moon is illuminated and c {$<$} 19.5 magnitude per exposure in dark skies. Construction is underway of two further units to be sited in Chile and South Africa which will result in an all-sky daily cadence from 2021. Initially designed for detecting potentially hazardous near earth objects, the ATLAS data enable a range of astrophysical time domain science. To extract transients from the data stream requires a computing system to process the data, assimilate detections in time and space and associate them with known astrophysical sources. Here we describe the hardware and software infrastructure to produce a stream of clean, real, astrophysical transients in real time. This involves machine learning and boosted decision tree algorithms to identify extragalactic and Galactic transients. Typically we detect 10\textendash 15 supernova candidates per night which we immediately announce publicly. The ATLAS discoveries not only enable rapid follow-up of interesting sources but will provide complete statistical samples within the local volume of 100 Mpc. A simple comparison of the detected supernova rate within 100 Mpc, with no corrections for completeness, is already significantly higher (factor 1.5 to 2) than the current accepted rates.},

  abstract = {Jupiter Family comets (JFCs) are short period comets which have recently entered the inner solar system, having previously orbited in the Kuiper Belt since the formation of the planets. We used two nights on the 3.6 m New Technology Telescope (NTT) at the European Southern Observatory, to obtain VRI photometry of three JFCs; 7P/Pons-Winnecke, 14P/Wolf and 92P/Sanguin. These were observed to be stellar in appearance. We find mean effective radii of 2.24 {$\pm$} 0.02 km for 7P, 3.16 {$\pm$} 0.01 km for 14P and 2.08 {$\pm$} 0.01 km for 92P, assuming a geometric albedo of 0.04. From light-curves for each comet we find rotation periods of 7.53 {$\pm$} 0.10 and 6.22 {$\pm$} 0.05 h for 14P and 92P respectively. 7P exhibits brightness variations which imply a rotation period of 6.8 {$\leq$} Prot {$\leq$} 9.5 h. Assuming the nuclei to be ellipsoidal the measured brightness variations imply minimum axial ratios a/b of 1.3 {$\pm$} 0.1 for 7P and 1.7 {$\pm$} 0.1 for both 14P and 92P. This in turn implies minimum densities of 0.23 {$\pm$} 0.08 g cm-3 for 7P, 0.32 {$\pm$} 0.02 g cm-3 for 14P and 0.49 {$\pm$} 0.06 g cm-3 for 92P.

Snapshot images were taken of 17 comets, of which five were not detected, three were active and nine were unresolved and apparently inactive. These include 103P/ Hartley 2, the target of the NASA Deep Impact extended mission, EPOXI. For six comets we obtained time-series photometry and use this to constrain the shape and rotation period of these nuclei. The data are not of sufficient quantity or quality to measure precise rotation periods, but the time-series do allow us to measure accurate effective radii and surface colours. Of the comets observed over an extended period, 40P/Va\textasciidieresis isa\textasciidieresis la\textasciidieresis{} 1, 47P/Ashbrook-Jackson and P/2004 H2 (Larsen) showed faint activity which limited the study of the nucleus. Light curves for 94P/Russell 4 and 121P/Shoemaker-Holt 2 reveal rotation periods of around 33 and 10 h, respectively, although in both cases these are not unique solutions. 94P was observed to have a large range in magnitudes implying that it is one of the most elongated nuclei known, with an axial ratio a/b 3. 36P/ Whipple was observed at five different epochs, with the INT and ESO's 3.6-m NTT, primarily in an attempt to confirm the preliminary short rotation period apparent in the first data set. The combined data set shows that the rotation period is actually longer than 24 h. A measurement of the phase function of 36P's nucleus gives a relatively steep {$\beta$} = 0.060 {$\pm$} 0.019. Finally, we discuss the distribution of surface colours observed in JFC nuclei, and show that it is possible to trace the evolution of colours from the Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) population to the JFC population by applying a `dereddening' function to the KBO colour distribution.},

We compare all of our findings to date with similar results for other comets and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). We find that the rotational properties of nuclei and KBOs are very similar, that there is evidence for a cut-off in bulk densities at {$\sim$}0.6 g cm-3 in both populations, and the colours of the two populations show similar correlations. For JFCs, there is no observational evidence for the optical colours being dependent on either position in the orbit or orbital parameters.},

  abstract = {Mutual events (MEs) are eclipses and occultations among planetary natural satellites. Most of the time, eclipses and occultations occur separately. However, the same satellite pair will exhibit an eclipse and an occultation quasi-simultaneously under particular orbital configurations. This kind of rare event is termed as a quasi-simultaneous mutual event (QSME). During the 2021 campaign of mutual events of jovian satellites, we observed a QSME between Europa and Ganymede. The present study aims to describe and study the event in detail. We observed the QSME with a CCD camera attached to a 300-mm telescope at the Hong Kong Space Museum Sai Kung iObservatory. We obtained the combined flux of Europa and Ganymede from aperture photometry. A geometric model was developed to explain the light curve observed. Our results are compared with theoretical predictions (O-C). We found that our simple geometric model can explain the QSME fairly accurately, and the QSME light curve is a superposition of the light curves of an eclipse and an occultation. Notably, the observed flux drops are within 2.6\% of the theoretical predictions. The size of the event central time O-Cs ranges from -14.4 to 43.2 s. Both O-Cs of flux drop and timing are comparable to other studies adopting more complicated models. Given the event rarity, model simplicity and accuracy, we encourage more observations and analysis on QSMEs to improve Solar System ephemerides.},

  abstract = {Polarization phase curves of asteroids and other small airless bodies are influenced by the compositional and physical properties of their regolith. The mixing of minerals composing the regolith influences the negative polarization at small phase angles because it changes the multiple scattering properties of the medium. This work aims to demonstrate experimentally how the mixing effect influences the polarization phase curve at small phase angles for different mineralogies relevant for asteroids, and to determine how different aggregate sizes affect the negative polarization. We prepared a set of binary and ternary mixtures with different common minerals on asteroids and one set of the same mixture with different aggregate sizes. We measured their reflected light at 530 nm with full Stokes polarimetry at phase angles ranging from 0.8\{\textbackslash deg\} to 30\{\textbackslash deg\}. The mixing effect of the mixtures with both bright and dark minerals significantly changes the behavior of the phase curves in terms of minimum polarization, phase angle of the minimum, and inversion angle with respect to the mineral components that are mixed together. The changes in phase curve could explain the polarization observation of particular classes of asteroids (F and L class) and other asteroids with peculiar polarization curves or photometric properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the negative polarization is invariant to the presence of dust aggregates up to centimeter sizes.},

  abstract = {Examining Arrokoth                            The New Horizons spacecraft flew past the Kuiper Belt object (486958) Arrokoth (also known as 2014 MU               69               ) in January 2019. Because of the great distance to the outer Solar System and limited bandwidth, it will take until late 2020 to downlink all the spacecraft's observations back to Earth. Three papers in this issue analyze recently downlinked data, including the highest-resolution images taken during the encounter (see the Perspective by Jewitt). Spencer               et al.               examined Arrokoth's geology and geophysics using stereo imaging, dated the surface using impact craters, and produced a geomorphological map. Grundy               et al.               investigated the composition of the surface using color imaging and spectroscopic data and assessed Arrokoth's thermal emission using microwave radiometry.

Arrokoth is a contact binary consisting of two distinct lobes, connected by a narrow neck. Its orbital parameters, albedo, and color make Arrokoth a typical cold classical KBO (CCKBO). CCKBOs are the most dynamically and physically primitive population of small Solar System bodies known.                                         RATIONALE               Since the publication of initial results from the flyby, additional data have been downlinked and analyzed. This paper describes the resulting analysis of Arrokoth's shape, geological evolution, and satellite and ring constraints.                                         RESULTS               Improved stereo imaging constrains the object's shape and topography and allows us to generate a stereographic terrain model. Typical relief on both lobes (away from the neck region) is \textasciitilde 0.5 km or smaller.                                Arrokoth's rotational period is 15.92 {$\pm$} 0.02 hours, with its rotational pole pointing to right ascension = 317.5 {$\pm$} 1\textdegree, declination = -24.9 {$\pm$} 1\textdegree, J2000 equinox. The object consists of two roughly ellipsoidal lobes with overall dimensions of 36 km by 20 km by 10 km. The maximum dimensions of the two lobes are 20.6 km by 19.9 km by 9.4 km and 15.4 km by 13.8 km by 9.8 km, with uncertainties of 0.5 km by 0.5 km by 2.0 km. The total volume is equal to a sphere of diameter 18.3 {$\pm$} 1.2 km, and the volume ratio of the two lobes is 1.9 {$\pm$} 0.5. Global bulk density must be {$>$}290 kg m                 -3                 if the neck is not in tension. Assuming a bulk density of 500 kg m                 -3                 , as measured for comets, the mean surface gravity is \textasciitilde 1 mm s                 -2                 , and the compressive strength of the neck must be {$>$}2.3 kPa.                              The two lobes are closely aligned. The maximum axis of inertia of the large lobe is aligned within {$<$}5\textdegree{} of that of the small lobe. The equatorial planes of the two lobes are also almost coincident in space.               The small lobe's surface is marked by complex albedo patterns, often with sinuous margins and no detectable topographic signature, whereas the large lobe's surface is dominated by clusters of low dark hills superposed on brighter, smoother terrain. The large lobe's surface is divided into distinct subunits, which may represent smaller bodies that accreted to form it, though the overall smoothness of the surface, and the youthful appearance of many boundaries, which are sometimes undetectable or cross-cut by clusters of hills, suggest a more complex postformation history. If the subunits did accrete first, the smoothness of their mutual boundaries suggests subsequent accretion of additional material and later reactivation of the boundaries.               We identify \textasciitilde 40 possible impact craters on Arrokoth, though only about 10 with high confidence. The largest crater, nicknamed Maryland, is about 7 km in diameter, and the rest are smaller than 1 km. Their size-frequency distribution is consistent with a single power law. Crater densities are lower than on many other small bodies but are consistent with a surface age of {$>$}4 billion years. No satellites or rings are detected: Satellite diameter upper limit is 180 m out to 8000-km radius from Arrokoth.                                         CONCLUSION               Arrokoth's smooth, lightly cratered surface is unlike that of other Solar System bodies and appears to date from the period of planetary accretion. The alignment of its two lobes constrains the processes that formed this contact binary. Because its orbit, albedo, color, and rotation are typical of other CCKBOs, Arrokoth can likely be used to understand the cold classical belt as a whole.                                                   Stereo image pair of Arrokoth.                   The left and center images can be viewed cross-eyed, or the right and center by direct viewing.                                                                         ,                             The Cold Classical Kuiper Belt, a class of small bodies in undisturbed orbits beyond Neptune, is composed of primitive objects preserving information about Solar System formation. In January 2019, the New Horizons spacecraft flew past one of these objects, the 36-kilometer-long contact binary (486958) Arrokoth (provisional designation 2014 MU               69               ). Images from the flyby show that Arrokoth has no detectable rings, and no satellites (larger than 180 meters in diameter) within a radius of 8000 kilometers. Arrokoth has a lightly cratered, smooth surface with complex geological features, unlike those on previously visited Solar System bodies. The density of impact craters indicates the surface dates from the formation of the Solar System. The two lobes of the contact binary have closely aligned poles and equators, constraining their accretion mechanism.},

The current core of Umbrella is an open-source modular library, called Umbrella2, that includes algorithms and interfaces for all steps of the processing pipeline, including a novel detection algorithm for faint trails.

In this paper we describe the library, focusing on the interfaces and algorithms available, and we present the results obtained with the desktop version on a set of well-curated fields used by the EURONEAR project as an asteroid detection benchmark.},

  abstract = {Conditions in the outer protoplanetary disk during Solar System formation were thought to be favorable for the formation of amorphous water ice (AWI),a glassy phase of water ice. However, subsequent collisional processing could have shock crystallized any AWI present. Here we use the iSALE shock physics hydrocode to simulate impacts between large icy bodies at impact velocities relevant to these collisional environments, and then feed these results into a custom-built AWI crystallization script, to compute how much AWI crystallizes/survives these impact events. We find that impact speeds between icy bodies post-planet migration (i.e., between trans-Neptunian Objects or TNOs) are too slow to crystallize any meaningful fraction of AWI. During planet migration, however, the amount of AWI that crystallizes is highly stochastic: relatively little AWI crystallizes at lower impact velocities (less than \textasciitilde 2 km/s), yet most AWI present in the bodies (if equal sized) or impactor and impact site (if different sizes) crystallizes at higher impact velocities (greater than \textasciitilde 4 km/s). Given that suspected impact speeds during planet migration were \textasciitilde 2-4 km/s, this suggests that primordial AWI's ability to survive planet migration is highly stochastic. However, if proto-EKB objects and their fragments experienced multiple impact events, nearly all primordial AWI could have crystallized; such a highly collisional proto-EKB during planet migration is consistent with the lack of any unambiguous direct detection of AWI on any icy body. Ultimately, primordial AWI's survival to the present day depends sensitively on the proto-EKB's size-frequency distribution, which is currently poorly understood.},

  abstract = {When is 3.3 million asteroid time-series observations enough? NEVER! Ask the AAVSO, which now has 30 million variable star observations - and counting. The problem is not the volume of data but that they are presented in so many different formats and styles that it's nearly impossible to handle hundreds of observations with a simple import program. Instead, the data must be manually dissected or hours spent modifying and testing the import program. This is made worse when it's unclear if any corrections or adjustments were applied to the raw data. To avoid uncertainty and manual processing of data, the Asteroid Lightcurve Data Exchange Format (ALCDEF) was created (Stephens et al., 2010). Since then, 3.3 million observations have been submitted via the alcdef.org web site where users can easily download selected data in the form of ALCDEF-compatible text files. The ALCDEF database has been used extensively by those doing asteroid spin axis and shape modeling (e.g., Hanus et al., 2011; 2012). That's just one of many potential uses for the data. A subset of the ALCDEF database recently went through the NASA PDS review process and was very favorably received. Work is now in progress to upload and make regular updates to the PDS version of the ALCDEF database. This means that those doing time-series asteroid photometry can submit their data via the ALCDEF web site and, optionally, have the data automatically transferred to the PDS. Thus, a single operation will simplify meeting NASA requirements for making data freely available and distribute them to the widest possible audience. In addition to these enhancements, the ALCDEF site will become part of NASA's Small Bodies Node and hosted on servers at the University of Maryland. This assures meeting requirements for long-term data archiving. With the large mass of sparse asteroid time-series data coming from surveys such as Pan-STARRS and LSST, a standard but simple format for submitting and retrieving data is even more imperative. We urge all those producing asteroid time-series photometry data to submit their data to ALCDEF and help "Save the Lightcurves."},

Now Stern               et al.               report the first scientific results from the high-speed encounter. The surface of Pluto is surprisingly diverse, with large regions of differing brightness and composition. There is ample evidence for ongoing rich geological processes that act to sculpt its surface. Charon's surface is similarly complex, with numerous relief structures and varied coloration. Pluto's atmosphere is extensive but less dense than expected, whereas Charon has no detectable atmosphere.                                         Science               , this issue p.               10.1126/science.aad1815                        ,              The first scientific results from New Horizon's flyby of Pluto reveal a rich and diverse geology.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Pluto was discovered in 1930 and was long thought to be a misfit or anomaly in the solar system. However, the 1992 discovery of the Kuiper Belt\textemdash a torus-shaped region beyond Neptune's orbit, and the largest structure in our three-zoned planetary system\textemdash provided new context, showing Pluto to be the largest of a new class of small planets formed in the outer solar system during the ancient era of planetary accretion \textasciitilde 4.5 billion years ago. NASA's New Horizons spacecraft made the first exploration of Pluto, culminating on 14 July 2015; it collected numerous remote sensing and in situ measurements of Pluto and its system of five moons. We report the first scientific results and interpretations of that flyby.                                         RATIONALE               The New Horizons spacecraft completed a close approach to the Pluto system at a distance of 13,691 km from Pluto's center. The spacecraft carries a sophisticated suite of scientific instruments, including the Ralph multicolor/panchromatic mapper and mapping infrared composition spectrometer; the LORRI long-focal-length panchromatic visible imager; the Alice extreme/far ultraviolet mapping spectrograph; twin REX radio science experiments; the SWAP solar wind detector; the PEPSSI high-energy charged particle spectrometer; and VBSDC, a dust impact detector. Together these instruments collected more than 50 gigabits of data on the Pluto system near the time of the spacecraft's closest approach.                                         RESULTS               We found that Pluto's surface displays a wide variety of landforms and terrain ages, as well as substantial albedo, color, and compositional variation. Evidence was also found for a water ice\textendash rich crust, geologically young surface units, tectonic extension, surface volatile ice convection, possible wind streaks, volatile transport, and glacial flow. Pluto's atmosphere is highly extended, with trace hydrocarbons, a global haze layer, and a surface pressure near 10 microbars. The bulk densities of Pluto and Charon were found to differ by less than 10\%, which is consistent with bulk rock contents for the two bodies that are likewise similar. This could imply that both precursor bodies were undifferentiated (or only modestly differentiated) prior to their collision\textemdash which would have profound implications for the timing, the duration, and even the mechanism of accretion in the ancestral Kuiper Belt.               Pluto's large moon Charon displays extensional tectonics and extensive resurfacing, as well as possible evidence for a heterogeneous crustal composition; its north pole displays puzzling dark terrain. The sizes of Pluto's small satellites Nix and Hydra were measured for the first time, as were their surface reflectivities, which are puzzlingly higher than Charon's. No new satellites were detected.                                         CONCLUSION               The New Horizons encounter revealed that Pluto displays a surprisingly wide variety of geological landforms, including those resulting from glaciological and surface-atmosphere interactions as well as impact, tectonic, possible cryovolcanic, and mass-wasting processes. This suggests that other small planets of the Kuiper Belt, such as Eris, Makemake, and Haumea, could express similarly complex histories that rival those of terrestrial planets. Pluto's diverse surface geology and long-term activity also raise fundamental questions about how it has remained active many billions of years after its formation.                                                   Pluto mosaic made from New Horizons LORRI images taken 14 July 2015 from a distance of 80,000 km.                   This view is projected from a point 1800 km above Pluto's equator, looking northeast over the dark, cratered, informally named Cthulhu Regio toward the bright, smooth expanse of icy plains informally called Sputnik Planum. Pluto's north pole is off the image to the left. This image mosaic was produced with panchromatic images from the New Horizons LORRI camera, with color overlaid from the Ralph color mapper onboard New Horizons.                                                                         ,              The Pluto system was recently explored by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft, making closest approach on 14 July 2015. Pluto's surface displays diverse landforms, terrain ages, albedos, colors, and composition gradients. Evidence is found for a water-ice crust, geologically young surface units, surface ice convection, wind streaks, volatile transport, and glacial flow. Pluto's atmosphere is highly extended, with trace hydrocarbons, a global haze layer, and a surface pressure near 10 microbars. Pluto's diverse surface geology and long-term activity raise fundamental questions about how small planets remain active many billions of years after formation. Pluto's large moon Charon displays tectonics and evidence for a heterogeneous crustal composition; its north pole displays puzzling dark terrain. Small satellites Hydra and Nix have higher albedos than expected.},

A local sky brightness and a magnitude are computed for each star in each of the specified stellar apertures, and for crowded fields, the empirical point-spread function must then be obtained for each data frame. The GROUP routine divides the star list for a given frame into optimum subgroups, and then the NSTAR routine is used to obtain photometry for all the stars in the frame by means of least- squares profile fits. The process is illustrated with images of stars in a crowded field, and shortcomings and possible improvements of the program are considered.},

  abstract = {More than a half of the asteroids in the main belt have irregular shapes with ratios of the minor to major axis lengths of less than 0.6. One of the mechanisms that create such shapes is collisions between asteroids. The relationship between the shapes of collisional outcomes and impact conditions such as impact velocities may provide information on the collisional environments and its evolutionary stages when those asteroids are created. In this study, we perform numerical simulations of collisional destruction of asteroids with radii 50 km and subsequent gravitational reaccumulation using smoothed-particle hydrodynamics for elastic dynamics with self-gravity, a model of rock fractures, and a model of friction in completely damaged rock. We systematically vary the impact velocity from 50 to 400 m s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$} and the impact angle from 5\textdegree{} to 45\textdegree. We investigate shapes of the largest remnants resulting from collisional simulations. As a result, various shapes (bilobed, spherical, flat, elongated, and hemispherical shapes) are formed through equal-mass and low-velocity (50-400 m s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}) impacts. We clarify a range of the impact angle and velocity to form each shape. Our results indicate that irregular shapes, especially flat shapes, of asteroids with diameters larger than 80 km are likely to be formed through similar-mass and low-velocity impacts, which are likely to occur in the primordial environment prior to the formation of Jupiter.}}},

The sample is complete at the faint end to r = 21.2 mag (apparent brightness) and H = 13.8 (absolute brightness, approximately corresponding to 10 km diameter). A subset of 297 detections of previously known Trojans were used to design and optimize a selection method based on observed angular velocity that resulted in the remaining objects. Using a sample of objects with known orbits, we estimate that the candidate sample contamination is about 3 per cent. The well-controlled selection effects, the sample size, depth and accurate five-band UV\textendash IR photometry enabled several new findings and the placement of older results on a firmer statistical footing. We find that there are significantly more asteroids in the leading swarm (L4) than in the trailing swarm (L5): N(L4)/N(L5) = 1.6 {$\pm$} 0.1, independently of limiting object's size. The overall counts normalization suggests that there are about as many Jovians Trojans as there are main-belt asteroids down to the same size limit, in agreement with earlier estimates. We find that Trojan asteroids have a remarkably narrow colour distribution (root mean scatter of only {$\sim$}0.05 mag) that is significantly different from the colour distribution of the main-belt asteroids. The colour of Trojan asteroids is correlated with their orbital inclination, in a similar way for both swarms, but appears uncorrelated with the object's size. We extrapolate the results presented here and estimate that the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will determine orbits, accurate colours and measure light curves in six photometric bandpasses for about 100 000 Jovian Trojan asteroids.},

  abstract = {The rotational states of the members in the dwarf planet - satellite systems in the transneptunian region are determined by the formation conditions and the tidal interaction between the components, and these rotational characteristics are the prime tracers of their evolution. Previously a number of authors claimed highly diverse values for the rotation period for the dwarf planet Eris, ranging from a few hours to a rotation (nearly) synchronous with the orbital period (15.8 d) of its satellite, Dysnomia. In this letter we present new light curve data of Eris, taken with \$\textbackslash sim\$1-2m-class ground based telescopes, and with the TESS and Gaia space telescopes. TESS data could not provide a well-defined light curve period, but could constrain light curve variations to a maximum possible light curve amplitude of \$\textbackslash Delta m\$ \$\textbackslash leq\$ 0.03 mag (1-\$\textbackslash sigma\$) for P \$\textbackslash leq\$ 24 h periods. Both the combined ground-based data and the Gaia measurements unambiguously point to a light curve period equal to the orbital period of Dysnomia, P = 15.8 d, with a light curve amplitude of \$\textbackslash Delta m\$ \$\textbackslash approx\$ 0.03 mag, i.e. the rotation of Eris is tidally locked. Assuming that Dysnomia has a collisional origin, calculations with a simple tidal evolution model show that Dysnomia has to be relatively massive (mass ratio of q = 0.01--0.03) and large (radius of \$R\_s\$ \$\textbackslash geq\$ 300 km) to slow down Eris to synchronized rotation. These simulations also indicate that -- assuming tidal parameters usually considered for transneptunian objects -- the density of Dysnomia should be 1.8-2.4 \$g cm\^\{-3\}\$, an exceptionally high value among similarly sized transneptunian objects, putting important constraints on the formation conditions.},

The catalog includes all the nuclear magnitudes reported after 1950 until August 1998 that appear in the International Comet Quarterly Archive of Cometary Photometric Data, the Minor Planet Center (MPC) data base, IAU Circulars, International Comet Quarterly, and a few papers devoted to some particular comets, together with our own observations.

We discuss the reliability of the reported nuclear magnitudes in relation to the inherent sources of errors and uncertainties, in particular the coma contamination often present even at large heliocentric distances. A large fraction of the JF comets of our sample indeed shows various degrees of activity at large heliocentric distances, which is correlated with recent downward jumps in their perihelion distances. The reliability of coma subtraction methods to compute the nuclear magnitude is also discussed. Most absolute nuclear magnitudes are found in the range 15 - 18, with no magnitudes fainter than HN {$\sim$} 19.5.},

  abstract = {The classification criterion between asteroids and comets has evolved in recent decades, but the main distinction remains unchanged. Comets present gas and dust ejection from the surface at some point of their orbits, therefore, these objects are considered to be active. On the other hand, asteroids do not show any kind of large scale gas and dust ejection, they are inert. Nevertheless, this classification scheme is impractical when we have more than 500,000 asteroids already discovered. In addition, comets are not active all along their orbits. In order for a comet to display activity at present or in the recent past in the inner region of the Solar System (heliocentric distance {$<$}2 AU), the cometary orbit must be unstable in the time scale on the order of ten thousands of years; otherwise, the object should have completely consumed its volatile component. Close encounters with the most massive planets is the only mechanism that could produce ``macroscopic'' instabilities on a short time scale. The macroscopic changes in the orbital elements can be detected in a numerical integration of the dynamical evolution of the object over a time scale of several thousand years. This procedure to identify asteroids in cometary-like orbits is also impractical because it would require months of computing time. Therefore, a classification scheme based on the orbital elements to identify the border cases between the asteroid and comet populations is urgently required.},

DART will release LICIACube prior to impact to obtain high-resolution post-impact images. The impact will produce a crater and a large amount of material ejected at high speed (several tens of m/s), producing an ejecta cone that will quickly disperse. We analyzed an additional effect: the lofting of material at low velocity due to the generation of seismic waves that propagate inside Dimorphos, producing surface shaking far from the impact point. We divide the process into different stages: from the generation of impact-induced waves, the interaction of them with surface particles, the ejection of dust particles at velocities, and the prediction of the observability of the dust coma and trail. We anticipate the following observable effects: i) generation of a dust cloud that will produce a hazy appearance of Dimorphos' surface, detectable by LICIACube; ii) brightness increase of the binary system due to enhancement of the cross section produced by the dust cloud; iii) generation of a dust trail, similar to those observed in some Active Asteroids, which can last for several weeks after impact. Numerical prediction of the detectability of these effects depends on the amount and size distribution of ejected particles, which are largely unknown. In case these effects are observable, an inversion method can be applied to compute the amount of ejected material and its velocity distribution, and discuss the relevance of the shaking process.},

  abstract = {The third data release by the Gaia mission of the European Space (DR3) is the first release to provide the community with a large sample of observations for more than 150 thousand Solar System objects, including asteroids and natural planetary satellites. The release contains astrometry (over 23 million epochs) and photometry, along with average reflectance spectra of 60518 asteroids and osculating elements. We present an overview of the procedures that have been implemented over several years of development and tests to process Solar System data at the level of accuracy that Gaia can reach. We illustrate the data properties and potential with some practical examples. In order to allow the users of DR3 to best exploit the data, we explain the assumptions and approaches followed in the implementation of the data processing pipeline for Solar System processing, and their effects in terms of data filtering, optimisation, and performances. We then test the data quality by analysing post-fit residuals to adjusted orbits, the capacity of detecting subtle dynamical effects (wobbling due to satellites or shape and Yarkovsky acceleration), and to reproduce known properties of asteroid photometry (phase curves and rotational light curves). The DR3 astrometric accuracy is a clear improvement over the data published in DR2, which concerned a very limited sample of asteroids. The performance of the data reduction is met, and is illustrated by the capacity of detecting milliarcsecond-level wobbling of the asteroid photocentre that is due to satellite or shape effects and contributes to Yarkovsky effect measurements. The third data release can in terms of data completeness and accuracy be considered the first full-scale realisation of the Solar System survey by Gaia.},

Methods: The NUV and visible reflectance spectrophotometry of more than 9,000 primitive asteroids was investigated using two spectrophotometric surveys, the Eight Color Asteroid Survey (ECAS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which cover wavelengths down to 0.32 um and 0.36 um, respectively. We classified asteroids from the main asteroid belt, the Cybele and Hilda zones, and Jupiter Trojans based on Tholen's taxonomy and described the statistical distribution of primitive asteroid types. We also examined the relationship of the NUV, 0.7 um, and 2.7 um absorptions among primitive asteroids and hydrous carbonaceous chondrites CI and CM. Results: We found strong correlations between the NUV and the OH-band (2.7 um) absorptions for primitive asteroids and hydrated meteorites, suggesting the NUV absorption can be indicative of hydrated silicates. Moreover, there is a great difference in the NUV absorption between the large asteroids (diameter d {$>$} 50 km) and small asteroids (d {$<$} 10 km) in the taxonomic distribution. The taxonomic distribution of asteroids differs between the inner main belt and middle-outer main belt. Notably, the C types are dominating large members through the main belt and the F types are dominating small asteroids of the inner main belt. The asteroids beyond the main belt consist mostly of P and D types, although P types are common everywhere in the main belt. The peculiar distribution of F types might indicate a different formation reservoir or displacement process of F types in the early Solar System.},

The CCs are primordial planetesimals and contain information about our solar system and planet formation over the first 100 million years after the Sun's formation. We obtained partial/ complete light curves for 42 CCs. We use statistical tests to derive general properties about the shape and rotational frequency distributions of the CCs and infer that they have slower rotations and are more elongated/deformed than the other TNOs. On the basis of the full light curves, the mean rotational period of the CCs is 9.48{$\pm$}1.53 hr compared to 8.45{$\pm$}0.58 hr for the rest of the TNOs. About 65\% of the TNOs have a light-curve amplitude below 0.2 mag compared to the 36\% of CCs with small amplitude. We present the full light curve of one likely contact binary, 2004VC131, with a potential density of 1 g cm-3 for a mass ratio of 0.4. We have hints that 2004MU8 and 2004VU75 are perhaps potential contact binaries, on the basis of their sparse light curves, but more data are needed to confirm this finding. Assuming equal-sized binaries, we find that {$\sim$}10\%\textendash 25\% of the CCs could be contact binaries, suggesting a deficit of contact binaries in this population compared to previous estimates and to the ({$\sim$}40\%\textendash 50\%) possible contact binaries in the Plutino population. These estimates are lower limits and may increase if nonequal-sized contact binaries are considered. Finally, we put in context the results of the New Horizons flyby of 2014MU69.},

The main survey's goal is to find objects displaying a large lightcurve amplitude which is indicative of contact binaries or highly elongated objects. In our sample, two 2:1 resonant TNOs showed a significant short-term lightcurve amplitude: 2002 VD\$\_\{130\}\$ and (531074) 2012 DX\$\_\{98\}\$. The full lightcurve of 2012 DX\$\_\{98\}\$ infers a periodicity of 20.80\$\textbackslash pm\$0.06h and amplitude of 0.56\$\textbackslash pm\$0.03mag whereas 2002 VD\$\_\{130\}\$ rotates in 9.85\$\textbackslash pm\$0.07h with a 0.31\$\textbackslash pm\$0.04mag lightcurve amplitude. Based on lightcurve morphology, we classify (531074) 2012 DX\$\_\{98\}\$ as a likely contact binary, but 2002 VD\$\_\{130\}\$ as a likely single elongated object. Based on our sample and the lightcurves reported in the literature, we estimate the lower percentage of nearly equal-sized contact binaries at only 7-14\$\textbackslash\%\$ in the 2:1 resonance, which is comparable to the low fraction reported for the dynamically Cold Classical trans-Neptunian objects. This low contact binary fraction in the 2:1 Neptune resonance is consistent with the lower estimate of the recent numerical modeling. We report the Sloan g', r', i' surface colors of 2002 VD\$\_\{130\}\$ which is an ultra-red TNO whereas 2012 DX\$\_\{98\}\$ is a very red object based on published surface colors.},

We combine albedo results from the ExploreNEOs Warm Spitzer Exploration Science program with taxonomic classifications from the literature, publicly available data sets, and new observations from our concurrent spectral survey to derive the average albedos for C-, D-, Q-, S-, V-, and X-complex NEOs. Using a sample size of 118 NEOs, we calculate average albedos of 0.29+-00..0054, 0.26+-00..0043, and 0.42+-00..1131 for the Q-, S-, and V-complexes, respectively. The averages for the C- and D-complexes are 0.13+-00..0065 and 0.02+-00..0021, but these averages are based on a small number of objects (five and two, respectively) and will improve with additional observations. We use albedos to assign X-complex asteroids to one of the E-, M-, or P-types. Our results demonstrate that the average albedos for the C-, S-, V-, and X-complexes are higher for NEOs than the corresponding averages observed in the Main Belt.},

They exist in a region of the solar system where long dynamical timescales and a low primordial density of material would have conspired to make the formation of such large bodies (\$15 and 17 times as massive as Earth, respectively) very difficult. Previously, we proposed a model that addressed this problem: Instead of forming in the trans-Saturnian region, Uranus and Neptune underwent most of their growth among proto-Jupiter and proto-Saturn, were scattered outward when Jupiter acquired its massive gas envelope, and subsequently evolved toward their present orbits. We present the results of additional numerical simulations, which further demonstrate that the model readily produces analogs to our solar system for a wide range of initial conditions. We also find that this mechanism may partly account for the high orbital inclinations observed in the Kuiper belt.},

We aim to assess the suitability in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) region of the solar analogues selected by the team responsible for the asteroid reflectance included in Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and to suggest a correction (in the form of multiplicative factors) to be applied to the Gaia DR3 asteroid reflectance spectra to account for the differences with respect to the solar analogue Hyades 64. Results. We find that the solar analogues selected for Gaia DR3 to compute the reflectance spectra of the asteroids of this data release have a systematically redder spectral slope at wavelengths shorter than 0.55 \{\textbackslash mu\}m than Hyades 64. We find that no correction is needed in the red photometer (RP, between 0.7 and 1 \{\textbackslash mu\}m), but a correction should be applied at wavelengths below 0.55 \{\textbackslash mu\}m, that is in the blue photometer (BP). After applying the correction, we find a better agreement between Gaia DR3 spectra, ECAS, HST, and our set of ground-based observations with the TNG. Conclusions. Correcting the near-UV part of the asteroid reflectance spectra is very important for proper comparisons with laboratory spectra (minerals, meteorite samples, etc.) or to analyse quantitatively the UV absorption (which is particularly important to study hydration in primitive asteroids). The spectral behaviour at wavelengths below 0.5 \{\textbackslash mu\}m of the selected solar analogues should be fully studied and taken into account for Gaia DR4},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             All near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) that reach sufficiently small perihelion distances will undergo a so-called super-catastrophic disruption. The mechanisms causing such disruptions are currently unknown or, at least, undetermined. To help guide theoretical and experimental work to understand the disruption mechanism, we use numerical simulations of a synthetic NEA population to identify the resonant mechanisms that are responsible for driving NEAs close to the Sun, determine how these different mechanisms relate to their dynamical lifetimes at small heliocentric distances and calculate the average time they spend at different heliocentric distances. Typically, resonances between NEAs and the terrestrial and giant planets are able to dramatically reduce the perihelion distances of the former. We developed an algorithm that scans the orbital evolution of asteroids and automatically identifies occurrences of mean motion and secular resonances. We find that most near-Sun asteroids are pushed to small perihelion distances by the 3:1J and 4:1J mean-motion resonances with Jupiter, as well as the secular resonances {$\nu$}6, {$\nu$}5, {$\nu$}3, and {$\nu$}4. The time-scale of the small-perihelion evolution is fastest for the 4:1J, followed by the 3:1J, whereas {$\nu$}5 is the slowest. Approximately 7~per\,cent of the test asteroids were not trapped in a resonance during the latest stages of their dynamical evolution, which suggests that the secular oscillation of the eccentricity due to the Kozai mechanism, a planetary close encounter, or a resonance that we have not identified pushed them below the estimated average disruption distance.},

  abstract = {Technology has advanced to the point that it is possible to image the entire sky every night and process the data in real time. The sky is hardly static: many interesting phenomena occur, including variable stationary objects such as stars or QSOs, transient stationary objects such as supernovae or M dwarf flares, and moving objects such as asteroids and the stars themselves. Funded by NASA, we have designed and built a sky survey system for the purpose of finding dangerous near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). This system, the ``Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System'' (ATLAS), has been optimized to produce the best survey capability per unit cost, and therefore is an efficient and competitive system for finding potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) but also for tracking variables and finding transients. While carrying out its NASA mission, ATLAS now discovers more bright (m{$<$}19) supernovae candidates than any ground based survey, frequently detecting very young explosions due to its 2 day cadence. ATLAS discovered the afterglow of a gamma-ray burst independent of the high energy trigger and has released a variable star catalog of 5\texttimes 106 sources. This is the first of a series of articles describing ATLAS, devoted to the design and performance of the ATLAS system. Subsequent articles will describe in more detail the software, the survey strategy, ATLAS-derived NEA population statistics, transient detections, and the first data release of variable stars and transient light curves.},

We focus on the collision rate of minor bodies around a Jupiter-like planet as a proof of concept. Using REBOUND package, we perform a series of detailed Nbody simulations to model the collisions, and show that our analytic formulation, ({$\Gamma$}coll) is consistent with the numerical results. On the other hand, the often-used O\textasciidieresis{} pik method for impact rates in the solar system ({$\Gamma$}opik), overestimates the collision rate by orders of magnitude, and is qualitatively different than the analytical formulation ({$\Gamma$}coll) and numerical simulations.

At present, we ingest data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public survey, and we will ingest data from the forthcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) when it comes online. SNAPS is an official LSST downstream broker. In this paper we present the SNAPS design goals and requirements. We describe the details of our automatic pipeline processing in which the physical properties of asteroids are derived. We present SNAPShot1, our first data release, which contains 5,458,459 observations of 31,693 asteroids observed by ZTF from 2018 July to 2020 May. By comparing a number of derived properties for this ensemble to previously published results for overlapping objects we show that our automatic processing is highly reliable. We present a short list of science results, among many that will be enabled by our SNAPS catalog: (1) we demonstrate that there are no known asteroids with very short periods and high amplitudes, which clearly indicates that in general asteroids in the size range 0.3\textendash 20 km are strengthless; (2) we find no difference in the period distributions of Jupiter Trojan asteroids, implying that the L4 and L5 clouds have different shape distributions; and (3) we highlight several individual asteroids of interest. Finally, we describe future work for SNAPS and our ability to operate at LSST scale.},

For some of these bodies, local acceleration near the equator may be directed outwards so that lift off of near-equatorial material is possible. In particular, this may be the case for asteroid Didymos, the primary of the (65803) Didymos binary system, which is the target of the DART (NASA) and Hera (ESA) space missions. The study of the dynamics of particles in such an environment has been carried out \textendash{} in the frame of the Hera mission and the EC-H2020 NEO-MAPP project \textendash{} according to the available shape model, known physical parameters and orbital information available before the DART impact. The presence of orbiting particles in the system is likely for most of the estimated range of values for mass and volume. The spatial mass density of ejected material is calculated for different particle sizes and at different heliocentric orbit epochs, revealing that large particles dominate the mass density distribution and that small particle abundance depends on observation epoch. Estimates of take off and landing areas on Didymos are also reported. Available estimates of the system mass and primary extents, after the DART mission, confirm that the main conclusions of this study are valid in the context of current knowledge.},

We fit their differential magnitude distribution to a single-slope power law with an index {$\alpha$} = 0.37 {$\pm$} 0.01, which corresponds to a cumulative size distribution with an index of b = 1.85 {$\pm$} 0.05. Combining our results with data for known asteroids, we obtained the size distribution of L5 Jupiter Trojans over the entire size range for 9 {$\lessequivlnt$} H V {$\leq$} 17, and found that the size distributions of the L4 and L5 swarms agree well with each other for a wide range of sizes. This is consistent with the scenario that asteroids in the two swarms originated from the same primordial population. Based on the above results, the ratio of the total number of asteroids with D {$\geq$} 2 km in the two swarms is estimated to be N L4/N L5 = 1.40 {$\pm$} 0.15, and the total number of L5 Jupiter Trojans with D {$\geq$} 1 km is estimated to be 1.1 \texttimes{} 105 by extrapolating the obtained distribution.},

The characteristics of 5120 asteroids detected by the survey, including their sizes and albedos, were cataloged in the Asteroid Catalog Using AKARI (AcuA). Size and albedo measurements were based on the standard thermal model, using inputs of infrared fluxes and absolute magnitudes measured at optical wavelengths. MBAs, which account for 4722 of the 5120 AcuA asteroids, have semimajor axes of 2.06\textendash 3.27 AU, except for the near-Earth asteroids. AcuA provides a complete data set of all MBAs brighter than the absolute magnitude of H {$<$} 10.3, which corresponds to the diameter of d {$>$} 20 km. We confirmed that the albedo distribution of the MBAs is strongly bimodal as was already known from the past observations, and that the bimodal distribution occurs not only in the total population, but also within inner, middle, and outer regions of the main belt. The bimodal distribution in each group consists of low-albedo components in C-type asteroids and high-albedo components in S-type asteroids. We found that the small asteroids have much more variety in albedo than the large asteroids. In spite of the albedo transition process like space weathering, the heliocentric distribution of the mean albedo of asteroids in each taxonomic type is nearly flat. The mean albedo of the total, on the other hand, gradually decreases with an increase in semimajor axis. This can be explained by the compositional ratio of taxonomic types; that is, the proportion of dark asteroids such as C- and D-types increases, while that of bright asteroids such as S-type decreases, with increasing heliocentric distance. The heliocentric distributions of X-subclasses: E-, M-, and P-types, which can be divided based on albedo values, are also examined. P-types, which are the major component in X-types, are distributed throughout the main belt regions, and the abundance of P-types increases beyond 3 AU. This distribution is similar to that of C- or D-types.},

This event provides unique scientific opportunities to study the asteroid, its orbit, and surface characteristics at an exceptionally close distance. In this paper we perform a synthetic geometrical, geographical and temporal analysis of the conditions under which the asteroid can be observed from Earth, with a particular emphasis on the conditions and scientific opportunities for bistatic radar observations, the only feasible radar technique applicable in such a close approach. For this purpose, we compile a list of present and future radio observatories around the globe which could participate in bistatic radar observation campaigns during the closest approach of Apophis. We estimate power, signal-to-noise ratios, surface coverage and other observing conditions. We find that a global collaboration of observatories in Australia, Africa, Europe and America might produce high-resolution delay-radar images with unprecedented signal-to-noise ratios and potential spatial resolution down to several meters, covering \$\textbackslash sim\$87\% of the asteroid surface. Moreover, if properly coordinated, the extreme approach of the asteroid might allow for radio amateur detection of the signals sent by large radio observatories and citizen science projects could then be organized. We also find that for visual observations, the mountain tops of Canary Islands will offer the best observing conditions during the closest approach, both for professionals as well as for amateurs. The apparent size of Apophis will be 2-3 times larger than typical seeing, allowing for resolved images of the surface.},

We obtained a rotational light curve amplitude of \$\{\textbackslash Delta\}\$m = 0.264 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.017 mag, a mean area-equivalent diameter of D\$\_\{A\_\{eq\}\}\$ = 545 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 13 km, and a geometric albedo of 0.134 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.010. The best triaxial shape obtained for VS\$\_2\$ has semiaxes a = 339 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 5 km, b = 235 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 6 km, and c = 226 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 8 km. The derived aspect angle is \$\{\textbackslash theta\}\$ = 59\$\{\textbackslash deg\} \textbackslash pm\$ 2\$\{\textbackslash deg\}\$ or its supplementary \$\{\textbackslash theta\}\$ = 121\$\{\textbackslash deg\} \textbackslash pm\$ 2\$\{\textbackslash deg\}\$, depending on the north-pole position. The spherical-volume equivalent diameter is D\$\_\{V\_\{eq\}\}\$ = 524 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 7 km. If we consider large albedo patches on its surface, the semi-major axis of the ellipsoid could be \textasciitilde 10 km smaller. These results are compatible with the previous ones determined from the single-chord 2013 and four-chord 2014 stellar occultations and with the effective diameter and albedo derived from Herschel and Spitzer data. They provide evidence that VS\$\_2\$'s 3D shape is not compatible with a homogeneous triaxial body in hydrostatic equilibrium, but it might be a differentiated body and/or might be sustaining some stress. No secondary features related to rings or material orbiting around VS\$\_2\$ were detected.},

Moreover, they are expected from any meteor observation survey, as a natural consequence of measurement error propagation. Here we examine if enough scientific data were published to identify the orbital and physical nature of CNEOS 2014-01-08. Given the lack of proof regarding the accuracy of the observation, the derivation of the trajectory, velocity and tensile strength, and given the current state of meteor observations and reduction tools, we find no scientific ground to conclude about the interstellar orbit nor the physical properties of CNEOS 2014-01-08. Moreover, given the current data release of this object, to find any piece at the bottom of the ocean seems extremely unlikely.},

The system's exquisite photometry with photometric errors {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.04mag , and well-defined filter and photometric system, allowed us to derive accurate H and G even with a limited number of observations and restricted range in phase angles. Our Monte Carlo method simulates each asteroid's rotation period, amplitude and color to derive the most-likely H and G, but its major advantage is in estimating realistic statistical + systematic uncertainties and errors on each parameter. The method was tested by comparison with the well-established and accurate results for about 500 asteroids provided by Pravec et al. (Pravec, P. et al. [2012]. Icarus 221, 365-387) and then applied to determining H and G for the Pan-STARRS1 asteroids using both the Muinonen et al. (Muinonen, K. et al. [2010]. Icarus 209, 542-555) and Bowell et al.

  abstract = {Context. Until recently, the 3D shape, and therefore density (when combining the volume estimate with available mass estimates), and surface topography of the vast majority of the largest (D {$\geq$} 100 km) main-belt asteroids have remained poorly constrained. The improved capabilities of the SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument have opened new doors into ground-based asteroid exploration. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: To constrain the formation and evolution of a representative sample of large asteroids, we conducted a high-angular-resolution imaging survey of 42 large main-belt asteroids with VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL. Our asteroid sample comprises 39 bodies with D {$\geq$} 100 km and in particular most D {$\geq$} 200 km main-belt asteroids (20/23). Furthermore, it nicely reflects the compositional diversity present in the main belt as the sampled bodies belong to the following taxonomic classes: A, B, C, Ch/Cgh, E/M/X, K, P/T, S, and V. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: The SPHERE/ZIMPOL images were first used to reconstruct the 3D shape of all targets with both the ADAM and MPCD reconstruction methods. We subsequently performed a detailed shape analysis and constrained the density of each target using available mass estimates including our own mass estimates in the case of multiple systems. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: The analysis of the reconstructed shapes allowed us to identify two families of objects as a function of their diameters, namely "spherical" and "elongated" bodies. A difference in rotation period appears to be the main origin of this bimodality. In addition, all but one object (216 Kleopatra) are located along the Maclaurin sequence with large volatile-rich bodies being the closest to the latter. Our results further reveal that the primaries of most multiple systems possess a rotation period of shorter than 6 h and an elongated shape (c/a {$\leq$} 0.65). Densities in our sample range from \textasciitilde 1.3 g cm\textsuperscript{-3} (87 Sylvia) to \textasciitilde 4.3 g cm\textsuperscript{-3} (22 Kalliope). Furthermore, the density distribution appears to be strongly bimodal with volatile-poor ({$\rho$} {$\geq$} 2.7 g cm\textsuperscript{-3}) and volatile-rich ({$\rho$} {$\leq$} 2.2 g cm\textsuperscript{-3}) bodies. Finally, our survey along with previous observations provides evidence in support of the possibility that some C-complex bodies could be intrinsically related to IDP-like P- and D-type asteroids, representing different layers of a same body (C: core; P/D: outer shell). We therefore propose that P/ D-types and some C-types may have the same origin in the primordial trans-Neptunian disk. {$<$}P /{$>$}Tables A.2 and A.3 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{$>$}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{$<$}/A{$>$} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/654/A56"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/654/A56{$<$}/A{$>$} {$<$}P /{$>$}Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the Paranal Observatory under programme ID 199.C-0074 (PI: P.

  abstract = {The Oort cloud is thought to be a reservoir of icy planetesimals and the source of long-period comets (LPCs) implanted from the outer Solar System during the time of giant planet formation. The abundance of rocky ice-free bodies is a key diagnostic of Solar System formation models as it can distinguish between ``massive" and ``depleted" proto-asteroid belt scenarios and thus disentangle competing planet formation models. Here we report a direct observation of a decimeter-sized (\$\textbackslash sim2\$ kg) rocky meteoroid on a retrograde LPC orbit (\$e \textbackslash approx 1.0\$, i = \$121\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$). During its flight, it fragmented at dynamic pressures similar to fireballs dropping ordinary chondrite meteorites. A numerical ablation model fit produces bulk density and ablation properties also consistent with asteroidal meteoroids. We estimate the flux of rocky objects impacting Earth from the Oort cloud to be \$1.08\^\{+2.81\}\_\{-0.95\} \textbackslash mathrm\{meteoroids/10\^6 km\^2/yr\}\$ to a mass limit of 10 g. This corresponds to an abundance of rocky meteoroids of \$\textbackslash sim6\^\{+13\}\_\{-5\}\$\textbackslash\% of all objects originating in the Oort cloud and impacting Earth to these masses. Our result gives support to migration-based dynamical models of the formation of the Solar System which predict that significant rocky material is implanted in the Oort cloud, a result not explained by traditional Solar System formation models.},

Here we demonstrate the citizen science project and its improved candidate selection process, and we give a progress report. We also present the VASCO citizen science network led by amateur astronomy associations mainly located in Algeria, Cameroon, and Nigeria. At the moment of writing, the citizen science project has carefully examined 15,593 candidate image pairs in the data (ca. 10\% of the candidates), and has so far identified 798 objects classified as "vanished".

In this paper, we have carried out the first optical searches ever for non-terrestrial artifacts near the Earth following the method proposed in Villarroel et al. (2022). We use images contained in the First Palomar Sky Survey to search for simultaneous (during a plate exposure time) transients that in addition to being point-like, are aligned. We provide a shortlist of the most promising candidates of aligned transients, that must be examined with the help of a microscope to separate celestial sources from plate defects with coincidentally star-like brightness profiles. We further explore one possible, but not unique, interpretation in terms of fast reflections off high-albedo objects in geosynchronous orbits around Earth. If a future study rules out each multiple transient candidate, the estimated surface density becomes an upper limit of \${$<$}10\^\{-9\}\$ objects km\$\^\{-2\}\$ non-terrestrial artifacts in geosynchronous orbits around Earth. Finally, we conclude that observations and analysis of multiple, simultaneously appearing and vanishing light sources on the sky merit serious further attention, regardless of their origin.},

  abstract = {In a Keplerian system, a large number of bodies orbit a central mass. Accretion disks, protoplanetary disks, asteroid belts, and planetary rings are examples. Simulations of these systems require algorithms that are computationally efficient. The inclusion of collisions in the simulations is challenging but important. We intend to calculate the time of collision of two astronomical bodies in intersecting Kepler orbits as a function of the orbital elements. The aim is to use the solution in an analytic propagator (\$N\$-body simulation) that jumps from one collision event to the next. We outline an algorithm that maintains a list of possible collision pairs ordered chronologically. At each step (the soonest event on the list), only the particles created in the collision can cause new collision possibilities. We estimate the collision rate, the length of the list, and the average change in this length at an event, and study the efficiency of the method used. We find that the collision-time problem is equivalent to finding the grid point between two parallel lines that is closest to the origin. The solution is based on the continued fraction of the ratio of orbital periods. Due to the large jumps in time, the algorithm can beat tree codes (octree and \$k\$-d tree codes can efficiently detect collisions) for specific systems such as the Solar System with \$N{$<$}10\^8\$. However, the gravitational interactions between particles can only be treated as gravitational scattering or as a secular perturbation, at the cost of reducing the time-step or at the cost of accuracy. While simulations of this size with high-fidelity propagators can already span vast timescales, the high efficiency of the collision detection allows many runs from one initial state or a large sample set, so that one can study statistics.},

  abstract = {Asteroids, planets, stars in some open clusters, as well as molecular clouds appear to possess a preferential spin-orbit alignment, pointing to shared processes that tie their rotation at birth to larger parent structures. We present a new mechanism that describes how collections of particles or 'clouds' gain a prograde rotational component when they collapse or contract while subject to an external, central force. The effect is geometric in origin, as relative shear on curved orbits moves their shared center-of-mass slightly inward and toward the external potential during a collapse, exchanging orbital angular momentum into aligned (prograde) rotation. We perform illustrative analytical and N-body calculations to show that this process of prograde spin-up proceeds quadratically in time (\$\textbackslash delta L\_\textbackslash mathrm\{rot\} \textbackslash propto t\^2\$) until the collapse nears completion. The total rotational gain increases with the size of the cloud prior to its collapse: \$\textbackslash delta L\_\textbackslash mathrm\{rot\}/L\_\textbackslash mathrm\{H\} \textbackslash propto (R\_\textbackslash mathrm\{cl\}/R\_\textbackslash mathrm\{H\})\^5\$, and typically with distance to the source of the potential (\$L\_\textbackslash mathrm\{H\}\textbackslash propto r\_0)\$. For clouds that form at the interface of shear and self-gravity (\$R\_\textbackslash mathrm\{cl\} \textbackslash sim R\_\textbackslash mathrm\{H\}\$), prograde spin-up means that even setups with large initial retrograde rotation collapse to form prograde-spinning objects. Being a geometric effect, prograde spin-up persists around any central potential that triggers shear, even those where the shear is strongly retrograde. We highlight an application to the Solar System, where prograde spin-up can explain the frequency of binary objects in the Kuiper belt with prograde rotation.},

  abstract = {Comets and small planetesimals are believed to contain primordial building blocks in the form of millimeter to centimeter sized pebbles. One of the viable growing mechanisms to form these small bodies is through the streaming instability (SI) in which pebbles cluster and gravitationally collapse toward a planetesimal or comet in the presence of gas drag. However, most SI simulations are global and lack the resolution to follow the final collapse stage of a pebble cloud within its Hill radius. We aim to track the collapse of a gravitationally bound pebble cloud subject to mutual collisions and gas drag with the representative particle approach. We determine the radial pebble size distribution of the collapsed core and the impact of mutual pebble collisions on the pebble size distribution. We find that virial equilibrium is never reached during the cloud evolution and that, in general, pebbles with a given Stokes number (St) collapse toward an optically thick core in a sequence from aerodynamically largest (St {$\sim$} 0.1) to aerodynamically smallest (St {$\sim$} 2 \texttimes{} 10-3). We show that at the location where the core becomes optically thick, the terminal velocity vt,{${_\ast}$} {$\sim$} 60 m s-1St2 is well below the fragmentation threshold velocity. While collisional processing is negligible during cloud evolution, the collisions that do occur are sticking. These results support the observations that comets and small planetary bodies are composed of primordial pebbles in the millimeter to centimeter size range.},

We analyzed the conditions of its origin and determined its age. We conducted dedicated observations of (458271) 2010 UM26 and 2010 RN221 in summer 2022 that resulted in a high-accuracy astrometric set of data. Joining them with the previously available observations, we improved the precision of the orbit determination of both asteroids. We used numerical simulations backward in time to constrain the origin of this new pair by observing orbital convergence in the Cartesian space. Using a large number of possible clone variants of (458271) 2010 UM26 and 2010 RN221 we find they all converge in a narrow time interval around March 2003 having extremely tight minimum distances (\$\textbackslash leq 1000\$ km) and minimum relative velocities (\$\textbackslash leq 3\$ cm\textasciitilde s\$\^\{-1\}\$). These conditions require to include mutual gravitational attraction of the asteroids constituting the pair for its age determination. Extending our model by this effect even improves the convergence results. We find there is more than \$55\$\textbackslash\% probability that the pair formed after the year 2000. However, quasi-satellite captures make the possible age uncertainty of this pair prolonged possibly to the 1960s. Still, this is by far the youngest known asteroid pair, a prime target for future astronomical observations.},

  abstract = {The most distant known trans-Neptunian objects (perihelion distance above 38 au and semimajor axis above 150 au) are of interest for their potential to reveal past, external, or present but unseen perturbers. Realizing this potential requires understanding how the known planets influence their orbital dynamics. We use a recently-developed Poincare mapping approach for orbital phase space studies of the circular planar restricted three body problem, which we have extended to the case of the three-dimensional restricted problem with \$N\$ planetary perturbers. With this approach, we explore the dynamical landscape of the 23 most distant TNOs under the perturbations of the known giant planets. We find that, counter to common expectations, almost none of these TNOs are far removed from Neptune's resonances. Nearly half (11) of these TNOs have orbits consistent with stable libration in Neptune's resonances; in particular, the orbits of TNOs 148209 and 474640 overlap with Neptune's 20:1 and 36:1 resonances, respectively. Five objects can be ruled currently non-resonant, despite their large orbital uncertainties, because our mapping approach determines the resonance boundaries in angular phase space in addition to semimajor axis. Only three objects are in orbital regions not appreciably affected by resonances: Sedna, 2012 VP113 and 2015 KG163. Our analysis also demonstrates that Neptune's resonances impart a modest (few percent) non-uniformity in the longitude of perihelion distribution of the currently observable distant TNOs. While not large enough to explain the observed clustering, this small dynamical sculpting of the perihelion longitudes could become relevant for future, larger TNO datasets.},

We describe the 31 securely resonant TNOs detected by OSSOS so far, and we use them to independently verify the resonant population models from the Canada\textendash France Ecliptic Plane Survey (CFEPS), with which we find broad agreement. We confirm that the 5:2 resonance is more populated than models of the outer solar system's dynamical history predict; our minimum population estimate shows that the high-eccentricity (e {$>$} 0.35) portion of the resonance is at least as populous as the 2:1 and possibly as populated as the 3:2 resonance. One OSSOS block was well suited for detecting objects trapped at low libration amplitudes in Neptune's 3:2 resonance, a population of interest in testing the origins of resonant TNOs. We detected three 3:2 objects with libration amplitudes below the cutoff modeled by CFEPS; OSSOS thus offers new constraints on this distribution. The OSSOS detections confirm that the 2:1 resonance has a dynamically colder inclination distribution than either the 3:2 or 5:2 resonances. Using the combined OSSOS and CFEPS 2:1 detections, we constrain the fraction of 2:1 objects in the symmetric mode of libration to 0.2\textendash 0.85; we also constrain the fraction of asymmetric librators in the leading island, which has been theoretically predicted to vary depending on Neptune's migration history, to be 0.05\textendash 0.8. Future OSSOS blocks will improve these constraints.},

The understanding of this population is derived from wide-ranging population studies of derived shape and spin, decades of observational studies in numerous wavelengths, evidence left behind from impacts on planets and moons, and the in situ study of a few objects via spacecraft flyby or rendezvous. The internal structure, however, which is responsible for the name rubble pile, is never directly observed but belies a violent history. Many or most of the asteroids on near-Earth orbits and those most accessible for rendezvous and in situ study are likely by-products of the continued collisional evolution of the main asteroid belt.},

The main data included in the LCDB are lightcurve rotation periods and amplitudes, color indices, H\textendash G parameters, diameters (actual or derived), basic binary asteroid parameters, and spin axis and shape models. As time permits we are reviewing existing entries to enter data not previously recorded (e.g., phase angle data). As of 2008 December, data for 3741 asteroids based on more than 10650 separate detail records derived from entries in various journals were included in the LCDB. Of those 3741 asteroids, approximately 3100 have data of sufficient quality for statistical analysis, including 7 that have ``dual citizenship'' \textendash{} meaning that they have (or had) asteroid designations as well comet designations. Here we present a discussion of the nature of LCDB data, i.e., which values are actually measured and which are derived. For derived data, we give our justification for specific values. We also present some analysis based on the LCDB data, including new default albedo (pV ) and phase slope parameter (G) values for the primary taxonomic classes and a review of the frequency\textendash diameter distribution of all asteroids as well as some selected subsets.

Each light curve consists of 20 or more observations acquired in a single opposition. Using 805 asteroids in our sample that have reference periods in the literature, we find that the reliability of our fitted periods is a complicated function of the period, amplitude, apparent magnitude, and other light-curve attributes. Using the 805-asteroid ground-truth sample, we train an automated classifier to estimate (along with manual inspection) the validity of the remaining {$\sim$}53,000 fitted periods. By this method we find that 9033 of our light curves (of {$\sim$}8300 unique asteroids) have ``reliable'' periods. Subsequent consideration of asteroids with multiple light-curve fits indicates a 4\% contamination in these ``reliable'' periods. For 3902 light curves with sufficient phase-angle coverage and either a reliable fit period or low amplitude, we examine the distribution of several phase-function parameters, none of which are bimodal though all correlate with the bond albedo and with visible-band colors. Comparing the theoretical maximal spin rate of a fluid body with our amplitude versus spin-rate distribution suggests that, if held together only by self-gravity, most asteroids are in general less dense than {$\sim$}2 g cm-3, while C types have a lower limit of between 1 and 2 g cm-3. These results are in agreement with previous density estimates. For 5\textendash 20 km diameters, S types rotate faster and have lower amplitudes than C types. If both populations share the same angular momentum, this may indicate the two types' differing ability to deform under rotational stress. Lastly, we compare our absolute magnitudes (and apparent-magnitude residuals) to those of the Minor Planet Center's nominal (G = 0.15, rotation-neglecting) model; our phase-function plus Fourier-series fitting reduces asteroid photometric rms scatter by a factor of {$\sim$}3.},

  abstract = {Using the New Horizons LORRI camera, we searched for satellites near five Kuiper belt objects (KBOs): four cold classicals (CCs: 2011 JY31, 2014 OS393, 2014 PN70, 2011 HZ102) and one scattered disk object (SD: 2011 HK103). These objects were observed at distances of 0.092-0.290 au from the New Horizons spacecraft, achieving spatial resolutions of 136-430 km (resolution is \textasciitilde 2 camera pixels), much higher than possible from any other facilities. Here we report that CC 2011 JY31 is a binary system with roughly equal brightness components, CC 2014 OS393 is likely an equal brightness binary system, while the three other KBOs did not show any evidence of binarity. The 2011 JY31 binary has a semi-major axis of 198.6 +/- 2.9 km, an orbital inclination of 61.34 +/- 1.34 deg, and an orbital period of 1.940 +/- 0.002 d. The 2014 OS393 binary objects have an apparent separation of \textasciitilde 150 km, making 2011 JY31 and 2014 OS393 the tightest KBO binary systems ever resolved. Both 2011 HK103 and 2011 HZ102 were detected with SNR\textasciitilde 10, and our observations rule out equal brightness binaries with separations larger than \textasciitilde 430 km and \textasciitilde 260 km, respectively. The spatial resolution for 2014 PN70 was \textasciitilde 200 km, but this object had SNR\textasciitilde 2.5-3, which limited our ability to probe its binarity. The binary frequency for the CC binaries probed in our small survey (67\%, not including 2014 PN70) is consistent with the high binary frequency suggested by larger surveys of CCs (Fraser et al. 2017, Noll et al. 2020) and recent planetesimal formation models (Nesvorny et al. 2021), but we extend the results to smaller orbit semi-major axes and smaller objects than previously possible.},

This large volume of data poses a computational challenge owing to both the large amount of information to be processed and the new methods needed to combine data from different sources (e.g. obtained by different techniques, in different bands, and having different random and systematic errors). The main goal of this work is to develop an algorithm capable of merging sparse and dense data sets, both relative and differential, in preparation for asteroid observations originating from, for example, Gaia, TESS, ATLAS, LSST, K2, VISTA, and many other sources. We present a novel method to obtain asteroid phase curves by combining sparse photometry and differential ground-based photometry. In the traditional approach, the latter cannot be used for phase curves. Merging those two data types allows for the extraction of phase-curve information for a growing number of objects. Our method is validated for 26 sample asteroids observed by the Gaia mission.},

  abstract = {Comets provide a valuable window into the chemical and physical conditions at the time of their formation in the young solar system. We seek insights into where and when these objects formed by comparing the range of abundances observed for nine molecules and their average values across a sample of 29 comets to the predicted midplane ice abundances from models of the protosolar nebula. Our fiducial model, where ices are inherited from the interstellar medium, can account for the observed mixing ratio ranges of each molecule considered, but no single location or time reproduces the abundances of all molecules simultaneously. This suggests that each comet consists of material processed under a range of conditions. In contrast, a model where the initial composition of disk material is `reset', wiping out any previous chemical history, cannot account for the complete range of abundances observed in comets. Using toy models that combine material processed under different thermal conditions we find that a combination of warm (CO-poor) and cold (CO-rich) material is required to account for both the average properties of the Jupiter-family and Oort cloud comets, and the individual comets we consider. This could occur by the transport (either radial or vertical) of ice-coated dust grains in the early solar system. Comparison of the models to the average Jupiter-family and Oort cloud comet compositions suggest the two families formed in overlapping regions of the disk, in agreement with the findings of A'Hearn et al. (2012) and with the predictions of the Nice model (Gomes et al. 2005, Tsiganis et al. 2005).},

Follow-up observations to supplement these sparse data may be prohibitively expensive in many cases, so to overcome these sampling limitations, we introduce a flexible model based on Gaussian processes to enable Bayesian parameter inference of asteroid time-series data. This model is designed to be flexible and extensible, and can model multiple asteroid properties such as the rotation period, light-curve amplitude, changing pulse profile, and magnitude changes due to the phase-angle evolution at the same time. Here, we focus on the inference of rotation periods. Based on both simulated light curves and real observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility, we show that the new model reliably infers rotational periods from sparsely sampled light curves and generally provides well-constrained posterior probability densities for the model parameters. We propose this framework as an intermediate method between fast but very limited-period detection algorithms and much more comprehensive but computationally expensive shape-modeling based on raytracing codes.},

Radiative transfer models that include excitation by collisions with neutrals and electrons, and by solar infrared radiation, were used to produce synthetic emission line profiles originating in the cometary coma. Ortho-to-para ratios (OPRs) were determined and used to derived water production rates for all comets. Comparisons are made with the water production rates derived using an OPR of 3. The OPR of three of the comets in this study is much lower than the statistical equilibrium value of 3; however they agree with observations of comets 1P/Halley and C/2001 A2 (LINEAR), and the protoplanetary disc TW Hydrae. These results provide evidence suggesting that OPR variation is caused by post-sublimation gas-phase nuclear-spin conversion processes. The water production rates of all comets agree with previous work and, in general, decrease with increasing nucleocentric offset. This could be due to a temperature profile, additional water source or OPR variation in the comae, or model inaccuracies.},

We aim to tackle this problem with machine learning (ML), in particular via residual neural networks. Our model is motivated by the underlying physical processes of the data-generating process and allows for flexible prediction of post-collision states. We demonstrate that our model outperforms commonly used collision handling methods such as perfect inelastic merging and feed-forward neural networks in both prediction accuracy and out-of-distribution generalization. Our model outperforms the current state of the art in 20/24 experiments. We provide a dataset that consists of 10164 Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of pairwise planetary collisions. The dataset is specifically suited for ML research to improve computational aspects for collision treatment and for studying planetary collisions in general. We formulate the ML task as a multi-task regression problem, allowing simple, yet efficient training of ML models for collision treatment in an end-to-end manner. Our models can be easily integrated into existing N-body frameworks and can be used within our chosen parameter space of initial conditions, i.e. where similar-sized collisions during late-stage terrestrial planet formation typically occur.},

  abstract = {The Jupiter Trojans are a significant population of minor bodies in the middle solar system that have garnered substantial interest in recent years. Several spectroscopic studies of these objects have revealed notable bimodalities with respect to near-infrared spectra, infrared albedo, and color, which suggest the existence of two distinct groups among the Trojan population. In this paper, we analyze the magnitude distributions of these two groups, which we refer to as the red and less red color populations. By compiling spectral and photometric data from several previous works, we show that the observed bimodalities are self-consistent and categorize 221 of the 842 Trojans with absolute magnitudes in the range H {$<$} 12.3 into the two color populations. We demonstrate that the magnitude distributions of the two color populations are distinct to a high confidence level ({$>$}95\%) and fit them individually to a broken power law, with special attention given to evaluating and correcting for incompleteness in the Trojan catalog as well as incompleteness in our categorization of objects. A comparison of the best-fit curves shows that the faint-end power-law slopes are markedly different for the two color populations, which indicates that the red and less red Trojans likely formed in different locations. We propose a few hypotheses for the origin and evolution of the Trojan population based on the analyzed data.},

This bimodality is indicative of two sub-populations within the Trojans, which have distinct size distributions. In this paper, we present a simple, plausible hypothesis for the origin and evolution of the two Trojan color sub-populations. In the framework of dynamical instability models of early solar system evolution, which suggest a common primordial progenitor population for both Trojans and Kuiper Belt objects, we use observational constraints to assert that the color bimodalities evident in both minor body populations developed within the primordial population prior to the onset of instability. We show that, beginning with an initial composition of rock and ices, location-dependent volatile loss through sublimation in this primordial population could have led to sharp changes in the surface composition with heliocentric distance. We propose that the depletion or retention of H2S ice on the surface of these objects was the key factor in creating an initial color bimodality. Objects that retained H2S on their surfaces developed characteristically redder colors upon irradiation than those that did not. After the bodies from the primordial population were scattered and emplaced into their current positions, they preserved this primordial color bimodality to the present day. We explore predictions of the volatile loss model\textemdash in particular, the effect of collisions within the Trojan population on the size distributions of the two sub-populations\textemdash and propose further experimental and observational tests of our hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Collisional families offer a unique window into the interior composition of asteroid populations. Previous dynamical studies of the Jupiter Trojans have uncovered a handful of potential collisional families, two of which have been subsequently confirmed through spectral characterization. In this paper, we present new multiband photometric observations of the proposed Ennomos family and derive precise \$g-i\$ colors of 75 candidate family members. While the majority of the targets have visible colors that are indistinguishable from background objects, we identify 13 objects with closely grouped dynamical properties that have significantly bluer colors. We determine that the true Ennomos collisional family is tightly confined to \$a'\_\{p\} {$>$} 5.29\$ au and \$0.45 {$<$} \textbackslash sin\{i\_\{p\}\} {$<$} 0.47\$, and the majority of its confirmed members have near-solar spectral slopes, including some of the bluest objects hitherto discovered in the Trojan population. The property of distinctly neutral colors that is shared by both the Ennomos family and the previously characterized Eurybates family indicates that the spectral properties of freshly exposed surfaces in the Jupiter region are markedly different than the surfaces of uncollided Trojans. This implies that the processes of ice sublimation and space weathering at 5.2 au yield a distinct regolith chemistry from the primordial environment within which the Trojans were initially accreted. It also suggests that the Trojans were emplaced in their present-day location from elsewhere sometime after the initial population formed, which is a key prediction of recent dynamical instability models of solar system evolution.},

The zero-elevation datum is defined by arbitrary and inconsistent conventions, especially on planets without a sea level, hence the lack of a universally standardized way to quantify relief. Furthermore, when quantifying relief on such planets, the elevation of a point is rather meaningless on its own, deriving most of its value when compared to the elevation of other points. In light of these considerations, this paper introduces a universally consistent framework for quantifying relief that does not require a datum altogether, and is instead based on physically meaningful concepts. Designed to be mathematically elegant and free of arbitrary parameters, the so-called datumless measures are divided into the datumless point measures and the datumless surface measures. As opposed to elevation, which describes the vertical position of a point relative to a datum, the datumless point measures directly describe the vertical position of a point relative to local terrain, making them useful for comparing the relief of features such as mountains across different planets. In the meantime, the datumless surface measures quantify various aspects of relief within a region, as opposed to that of a single point. This is done through datumless formulations of surface area and surface mean value, which can be directly applied to the fractal-like planetary surface without projecting it onto a reference ellipsoid. Altogether, this paper lays the groundwork for a datumless framework that enables future topographic tasks to transcend the limitations of elevation.},

  abstract = {The Yarkovsky effect plays an important role in the motions of small celestial bodies. Increasingly improving observations bring the need of high-accuracy modelling of the effect. Using a multiphysics software COMSOL, we model the diurnal Yarkovsky effect in three dimensions and compare the results with that derived from the widely adopted theoretical linear model. We find that the linear model presents a high accuracy for spherical asteroids in most cases. The ranges of parameters in which the relative error of the linear model is over 10\textbackslash\% are explored. For biaxial ellipsoidal asteroids (particularly oblate ones), the linear model systematically overestimates the transverse Yarkovsky force by \$\textbackslash sim\$10\textbackslash\%. The diurnal effect on triaxial ellipsoids is periodic for which no linear model is available. Our numerical calculations show that the average effects on triaxial ellipsoids are stronger than that on biaxial ellipsoids. We also investigate the diurnal effect on asteroids of real shapes and find it be overestimated by the linear model averagely by 16\textbackslash\%, with a maximum up to 35\textbackslash\%. To estimate the strength of Yarkovsky effect directly from the shape, we introduce a quantity "effective area" for asteroids of any shapes, and find a significant linear relationship between the Yarkovsky migration rate and the effective area. This brings great convenience to the estimation in practice.},

On the other hand, recent simulations of the streaming instability have shown that mm/cm-sized particles require an excessively high metallicity for dense filaments to emerge. Using a numerical algorithm for stiff mutual drag force, we perform simulations of small particles with significantly higher resolutions and longer simulation times than in previous investigations. We find that particles of dimensionless stopping time {$\tau$}s = 10-2 and 10-3 \textendash{} representing cm- and mm-sized particles interior of the water ice line \textendash{} concentrate themselves via the streaming instability at a solid abundance of a few percent. We thus revise a previously published critical solid abundance curve for the regime of {$\tau$}s 1. The solid density in the concentrated regions reaches values higher than the Roche density, indicating that direct collapse of particles down to mm sizes into planetesimals is possible. Our results hence bridge the gap in particle size between direct dust growth limited by bouncing and the streaming instability.},

Here we present an investigation into the underlying cause using serendipitous survey detections and targeted observations. We find that the detection of the activity is caused by an extremely faint coma being enhanced by the forward scattering effect owing to the comet reaching a phase angle of {$\sim$}140\textdegree. The coma morphology is consistent with sustained, sublimationdriven activity produced by a small active area, {$\sim$}700 m2, one of the smallest values ever measured on a comet. The phase function of the nucleus shows a phase coefficient of 0.035 {$\pm$} 0.002 mag deg-1, implying an absolute magnitude of H = 18.31 {$\pm$} 0.04 and a phase slope of G = - 0.13, with color consistent with typical JFC nuclei. Thermal observations suggest a nucleus diameter of 0.6\textendash 1.1 km, implying an optical albedo of 0.04\textendash 0.23, which is higher than typical cometary nuclei. An unsuccessful search for dust trail and meteor activity confirms minimal dust deposit along the orbit, totaling 108 kg. As P/2021 HS is dynamically unstable, similar to typical JFCs, we speculate that it has an origin in the trans-Neptunian region and that its extreme depletion of volatiles is caused by a large number of previous passages to the inner solar system. The dramatic discovery of the cometary nature of P/2021 HS highlights the challenges of detecting comets with extremely low activity levels. Observations at high phase angle, where forward scattering is pronounced, will help identify such comets.},

We call this survey SMBAS (Sub-km Main-Belt Asteroid Survey). Observations were carried out on 2001 February 22 and 25 (HST) and a {$\sim$} 3.0 deg2 sky area near the opposition and near the ecliptic was searched. We detected 1111 moving objects down to R {$\sim$} 26 mag (including very slow TransNeptunian Objects). In this survey, we could not determine the exact orbits of the moving objects, because of their short observational arc of only 2 hours. Instead, we statistically estimated the semi-major axis (a) and inclination (I ) of each moving object from its apparent sky-motion vector, and then obtained the size and spatial distributions of sub-km MBAs. The main results of SMBAS are: (1) The sky number density of MBAs is found to be {$\sim$} 290 deg-2 down to R {$\sim$} 24.4 mag (for MBAs) near the opposition and near the ecliptic. (2) The slope of the cumulative size distribution for sub-km MBAs ranging from 0.5 km to 1 km in diameter is fairly shallower ({$\sim$} 1.2) than that for large MBAs of more than {$\sim$} 5 km in diameter ({$\sim$} 1.8), which was obtained from past asteroid surveys. This means that the number of sub-km MBAs is much more depleted than a result extrapolated from the size distributions for large asteroids. (3) The depletion of sub-km MBAs is clearer in the outer main-belt than in the inner main-belt. (4) It seems that SMBAS asteroids distribute more widely in the I -direction in the outer zone (a = 2.8\textendash 3.1 AU) of the main-belt than known large asteroids do. We also discuss the possible causes for the characteristics of the distributions of SMBAS-observed small asteroids.},

  abstract = {Interpenetrating streams of solids and gas in a Keplerian disk produce a local, linear instability. The two components mutually interact via aerodynamic drag, which generates radial drift and triggers unstable modes. The secular instability does not require self-gravity, yet it generates growing particle-density perturbations that could seed planetesimal formation. Growth rates are slower than dynamical but faster than radial drift timescales. Growth rates, like streaming velocities, are maximized for marginal coupling (stopping times comparable to dynamical times). Fastest growth occurs when the solid-to-gas density ratio is order unity and feedback is strongest. Curiously, growth is strongly suppressed when the densities are too nearly equal. The relation between background drift and wave properties is explained by analogy with Howard's semicircle theorem. The three-dimensional, two-fluid equations describe a sixth-order (in the complex frequency) dispersion relation. A terminal velocity approximation allows simplification to an approximate cubic dispersion relation. To describe the simplest manifestation of this instability, we ignore complicating (but possibly relevant) factors such as vertical stratification, dispersion of particle sizes, turbulence, and self-gravity. We consider applications to planetesimal formation and compare our work to other studies of particle-gas dynamics.},

Color imaging by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) during the 2022 May apparition indicates that the observed brightening and tail development instead capture the release of sodium atoms, which resonantly fluoresce at the 589.0/589.6 nm D lines. While HI1's design bandpass nominally excludes the D lines, filter degradation has substantially increased its D line sensitivity, as quantified by the brightness of Mercury's sodium tail in HI1 imagery. Furthermore, the expected fluorescence efficiency and acceleration of sodium atoms under solar radiation readily reproduce both the photometric and morphological behaviors observed by LASCO and HI1 during the 2022 apparition and the 17 earlier apparitions since 1997. This finding connects Phaethon to the broader population of sunskirting and sungrazing comets observed by SOHO, which often also exhibit bright sodium emission with minimal visible dust, but distinguishes it from other sunskirting asteroids without detectable sodium production under comparable solar heating. These differences may reflect variations in the degree of sodium depletion of near-surface material and thus the extent and/or timing of any past or present resurfacing activity.},

While the YORP effect induced by the macroscopic shape of the asteroid and by the presence of surface boulders has been well studied, no investigation has been performed yet regarding how craters with given properties influence this effect. We introduce and estimate the crater-induced YORP effect (CYORP), which arises from the concave structure of the crater, to investigate the magnitude of the resulting torques as a function of varying properties of the crater and the asteroid by a semi-analytical method. The CYORP torque can be comparable to the normal YORP torque when the size of the crater is about one-tenth of the size of the asteroid, or equivalently when the crater/roughness covers one-tenth of the asteroid's surface. Although the torque decreases with the crater size, the combined contribution of all small craters can become non-negligible due to their large number when the commonly used power-law crater size distribution is considered. The CYORP torque of small concave structures, usually considered as surface roughness, is essential to the accurate calculation of the complete YORP torque. Under the CYORP effect that is produced by collisions, asteroids go through a random walk in spin rate and obliquity, with a YORP reset timescale typically of 0.4 Myr. This has strong implications for the rotational evolution and orbital evolution of asteroids. Craters and roughness on asteroid surfaces can influence the YORP torques and therefore the rotational properties and evolution of asteroids. We suggest that the CYORP effect should be considered in the future investigation of the YORP effect on asteroids.},

  abstract = {We scrutinize the light sail scenario of the first interstellar object (ISO) 1I/2017 U1 (`Oumuamua) by making comparisons between physical models and observational constraints. These analyses can be generalized for future surveys of `Oumuamua-like objects. The light sail goes through a drift in the interstellar space due to the magnetic field and gas atoms, which poses challenges to the navigation system. When the light sail enters the inner solar system, the sideways radiation pressure leads to a considerable non-radial displacement. The immensely high dimensional ratio and the tumbling motion could cause a light curve with an extremely large amplitude and could even make the light sail invisible from time to time. These observational features allow us to examine the light sail scenario of interstellar objects. Our results show that the drift of the freely rotating light sail in the interstellar medium is \$\textbackslash sim 100\textbackslash,\$au even if the travel distance is only 1 pc. The probability is {$<$} 1.5\textbackslash\% for the expected brightness modulation of the light sail to match with `Oumuamua's observed variation amplitude (\$\textbackslash sim\$ 2.5 -- 3). In addition, the probability is 0.4\% for the tumbling light-sail to be visible (brighter than V=27) in all 55 observations spread over two months after discovery. Radiation pressure could cause a larger displacement that is normal to the orbital plane for a lightsail than that for `Oumuamua. Also, the ratio of anti-solar to sideways acceleration of `Oumuamua deviates from that of the light sail by \textasciitilde{} 1.5\{\textbackslash sigma\}. We suggest that `Oumuamua is unlikely a light sail. The dynamics of an intruding light sail, if exist, has distinct observational signatures, which can be quantitatively identified and analyzed with our methods in future surveys.},

  abstract = {Methods. Using photometric data obtained by the TESS satellite we determined the pulsational properties of the exoplanet host star {$\beta$} Pictoris through frequency analysis. We then pre-whitened the 54 identified {$\delta$} Scuti p-modes and investigated the residual photometric time series for the presence of FEBs. Results. We identify three distinct dipping events in the light curve of {$\beta$} Pictoris over a 105-day period. These dips have depths from 0.5 to 2 millimagnitudes and durations of up to 2 days for the largest dip. These dips are asymmetric in nature and are consistent with a model of an evaporating comet with an extended tail crossing the disc of the star Conclusions. We present the first broadband detections of exocomets crossing the disc of {$\beta$} Pictoris, complementing the predictions made 20 years earlier by Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. (1999, A\&A, 343, 916). No periodic transits are seen in this time series. These observations confirm the spectroscopic detection of exocomets in calcium H and K lines that have been seen in high resolution spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments measuring the temperature and polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background, like WMAP (Bennett et al., 2013) and Planck (Planck Collaboration, 2018), produce all-sky maps at higher and higher resolution. Handling those datasets efficiently and studying their statistical properties requires a discretization scheme on the sphere. The Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization, HEALPix (G\'orski et al., 2005), scheme (see Fig. 1) has proven to be an excellent mathematical framework to store mapdomain data and efficiently compute their Spherical Harmonics Transform, whose Angular Power Spectrum is one the most powerful tools to understand the early Universe.},
